## Care Groups Review — 2026-05-03

### Fixed ✅ (implemented this session)

- [x] **[CRITICAL BUG] Polling timeout 30s vs QR validity 10min** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — Creator's partner scans QR, completes signup (>30s), polling had already stopped so creator never saw "connected." Extended polling to 10 minutes to match QR expiry. Added `qr-timeout` step with warm recovery UI: "Share a new invite link" or "Continue without them — I'll invite them later."

- [x] **[CRITICAL BUG] Post-QR-join loop back to care-group step** — `onboarding/page.tsx` + `OnboardingShell.tsx` — `/join` route redirected to `/onboarding?careGroupId=X&joined=true` but page ignored those params. User B was re-shown the "Create or Join a Care Group" screen they'd already completed. Fixed: page now queries `care_group_members` on load; if user is already a member, `initialCareGroupId` prop skips the care-group phase in `OnboardingShell`.

- [x] **[BUG] Invite error params silently dropped** — `onboarding/page.tsx` — `/join` route redirected with `?error=group-full/invite-expired/invite-used/invite-revoked/invite-not-found` but the onboarding page ignored all of them. Users saw a blank screen with no explanation. Fixed: `INVITE_ERROR_MESSAGES` map translates error codes to warm, human messages. `OnboardingShell` renders a `role="alert"` error banner above the flow.

- [x] **[BUG] Silent blank screen when inviteUrl is null** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — After creating a group, if the invite API call failed, `step='qr'` with `inviteUrl=null` rendered nothing. Fixed: added fallback UI ("Having trouble generating the invite link — tap to try again").

- [x] **[UX] Copy link had no feedback** — `QRCodePanel.tsx` — `navigator.clipboard.writeText(url)` silently succeeded. Users had no confirmation. Fixed: `copied` state shows "✓ Copied!" with purple highlight for 2 seconds.

- [x] **[UX] Password min length not shown** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — API enforces 4-char min, UI showed no hint. Server error was the first indication. Fixed: `aria-describedby` hint "At least 4 characters. Share this with your care partner so they can join."

- [x] **[A11Y] No password show/hide toggle** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — Critical for elderly patients and caregivers who need to confirm what they typed before sharing it. Fixed: eye icon toggle with `aria-label="Show/Hide password"`.

- [x] **[COPY] QR panel hardcoded "Share with your patient"** — `QRCodePanel.tsx` — When a patient creates the group, the prompt was wrong. Fixed: role-aware — patients see "Share with your caregiver", everyone else sees "Share with your patient."

- [x] **[A11Y] Waiting status not announced to screen readers** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — "Waiting for them to join" status had no `aria-live`. Fixed: `role="status" aria-live="polite"` on the waiting indicator.

- [x] **[COPY] ConnectedCelebration CTA cold** — `ConnectedCelebration.tsx` — "Continue to setup →" felt transactional at a moment of real emotional significance. Changed to "Let's get started →" and subtitle from "Your care journey starts now." to "You're not doing this alone anymore."

- [x] **[COPY] Subheadings warmed up** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — Caregiver: "Connect with your patient so you can support them and share their health journey." Patient/self: "Connect with a family member or caregiver so they can be part of your care." Card descriptions now explain what happens after joining.

- [x] **[COPY] Error messages humanized** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — Join error fallback changed from "Something went wrong" to "We couldn't find that group. Double-check the name and password with whoever created it." All error copy now speaks to a person in a stressful situation, not a developer reading logs.

- [x] **[BUG] invite API throw left user stuck after group creation** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — If the `/api/care-group/invite` fetch threw (network error), the group was created in the DB but the user stayed on `create-form` with no error and no navigation. Fixed: invite call wrapped in inner try/catch — group creation proceeds to `qr` step regardless, and the `inviteUrl=null` fallback UI already handles the missing link.

- [x] **[UX] Enter key didn't submit care group forms** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — The form used `<div>` wrappers with `onClick` buttons. Pressing Enter after filling name + password did nothing. Fixed: wrapped in `<form onSubmit>` with `type="submit"` button. Both keyboard and mobile keyboard `Go` button now submit.

- [x] **[UX] No inline password validation** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — API enforces 4-char minimum but users only found out after hitting the server error. Fixed: live indicator shows "2 more characters needed" while typing, turns green with "Good — share this with your care partner" at ≥4 chars. Submit button disabled until valid.

- [x] **[UX] Share button silently failed on desktop** — `QRCodePanel.tsx` — `navigator.share` is mobile-only; clicking Share on desktop did nothing with no feedback. Other components in the codebase (HealthSummaryView, VisitPrepSheet) correctly check `typeof navigator.share === 'function'`. Fixed: Share button hidden when API unavailable; Copy button expands to full width as the primary share action on desktop.

- [x] **[COPY] "the link is valid for 10 minutes" was wrong** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx:347` — Invite tokens expire in 7 days (`TOKEN_EXPIRY_DAYS = 7`). The QR code display blurs after 10 min for UX, but the URL itself stays valid much longer. Copy said "the link is valid for 10 minutes" which would cause users to panic if their partner didn't scan immediately. Fixed: changed to "Waiting for them to join…"

- [x] **[UX] qr-timeout step broke visual continuity** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — The timeout state was an early return with a completely different container structure, losing the "Your Care Group" header and matching padding. Fixed: moved into the main return with conditional heading "No rush — they can join later" and consistent container layout.

- [x] **[UX] connectedName always hardcoded 'Your care partner' in join flow** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — After joining a group, the celebration screen showed "Y" initial and "Your care partner" label. Fixed: after successful join, fetches `/api/care-group/[id]/status` to get the existing member's real display name. Falls back gracefully to group name if the status fetch fails.

- [x] **[A11Y] No focus rings on inputs or buttons** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx`, `ConnectedCelebration.tsx` — `focus:outline-none` on inputs removed the browser's default focus indicator, making keyboard navigation invisible. Fixed: added `focus-within:ring-1 focus-within:ring-violet-400/40` on input containers and `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-violet-400/60` on primary buttons.

- [x] **[A11Y] Touch targets too small on skip/continue links** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — "Skip for now", "Continue without waiting", and "Continue on my own" links had no padding (`text-xs text-center`), making them hard to tap on mobile (likely <30px hit area). Fixed: added `py-2 px-3 rounded-lg` for adequate touch target. Also bumped text opacity from 0.3 → 0.45 for better contrast.

- [x] **[UX] ConnectedCelebration had no celebration effect** — `ConnectedCelebration.tsx` — The connected moment is emotionally significant: two people facing a cancer journey agreeing to face it together. The static emoji row didn't match that weight. Fixed: added a CSS burst confetti effect (28 particles in brand colors: violet, indigo, sky, emerald, amber, pink) that fires from the avatar connection point when the reveal animation starts. Pure CSS/React, no new dependencies.

### Deferred (TODO)

- [ ] **[MISSING] No way to manage care group after onboarding** — Users have no screen to view members, leave a group, or invite new people after completing onboarding. A patient who wants to add a second caregiver later has no path.
  - **Why:** Care teams change — new family members come on board, caregivers rotate. This is especially true over a longer treatment journey.
  - **Fix:** Add a "Care Group" section in Settings (`/settings` page). Show members list, role, joined date. Allow owner to invite new members (reuse QRCodePanel) and remove members. Allow any member to leave.
  - **Where to start:** `apps/web/src/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx` — add a Care Group card. New `apps/web/src/components/CareGroupSettings.tsx` for the management UI.

- [ ] **[MISSING] No revoke invite UI** — The invite API returns a 400 "You have too many pending invites. Revoke one to create a new one." error when the 5-invite limit is hit, but there's no UI to revoke. Users are stuck.
  - **Why:** Power users who share many invite links (e.g. for a large family) will hit this and have no recourse.
  - **Fix:** In `CareGroupSettings.tsx` (above), list active invites with a revoke button. Add `DELETE /api/care-group/invite/[id]` route that sets `revokedAt`.
  - **Depends on:** Care group settings screen above.

- [ ] **[A11Y] Skip navigation not present on care-group form** — No `<a href="#main-form">Skip to form</a>` link at top of `CareGroupScreen`. Not blocking for a focused 2-step flow but needed for full WCAG 2.4.1 (Level A) compliance.
  - **Fix:** Low-effort — add sr-only skip link before the heading. Same pattern as trials page.

- [ ] **[UX] No confirmation when re-entering onboarding while already in a group** — If a user who is already in a care group navigates to `/onboarding` manually, they land on the wizard phase (correctly skipping care-group), but there's no message saying "You're already in a care group." Could be confusing.
  - **Fix:** When `initialCareGroupId` is set and `phase` starts as `wizard`, show a subtle "You're already in a care group 💜" note at the top of the wizard.
  - **Where to start:** `OnboardingShell.tsx` — add a conditional note when `initialCareGroupId` and `phase === 'wizard'`.

- [ ] **[PERF] `care_group_members` query on every onboarding page load** — `onboarding/page.tsx` now queries membership on every load to detect existing group. Fine at low scale but adds a DB round-trip to a high-frequency path (every auth'd user lands here on first login).
  - **Why:** Worth noting if Aurora cold-start latency compounds with this extra query under load.
  - **Fix if needed:** Cache the membership query result client-side (localStorage keyed by userId) for 5 minutes, then revalidate. Only worth doing if p99 onboarding load time degrades.

- [ ] **[TEST] All care-group route tests are smoke tests of JS boolean logic** — `apps/web/src/app/api/care-group/__tests__/route.test.ts` — All 17 tests assert things like `expect('abc'.length).toBeLessThan(4)` and `expect([...].length >= MAX_MEMBERS).toBe(true)`. They test JavaScript, not the application. None touch the actual route handlers, DB, auth, or CSRF validation. The join flow has zero integration test coverage.
  - **Why:** If the DB schema changes, the join/create/invite logic breaks silently — no test would catch it.
  - **Fix:** Replace with integration tests using a real DB (vitest + local Aurora/PG). Test the full request path: auth → CSRF → DB insert → response. At minimum: create group (success, collision, validation), join (success, wrong name, wrong password, full, duplicate), invite (success, member cap hit, non-member rejected).
  - **Note:** Tests should follow the existing pattern in `reset-password/__tests__/route.test.ts` which uses fetch mocks properly.

- [ ] **[A11Y] profileCreateError retry bug in OnboardingShell** — `OnboardingShell.tsx:117` — The "try again" button in the profile create error state calls `setProfileCreateError(false)` which returns the user to the care-group screen, not to the profile creation retry. The user has to re-complete the care-group phase to trigger profile creation again.
  - **Why:** Cancer patients in onboarding are already stressed. Hitting an error and then having to redo work erodes trust.
  - **Fix:** Store `careGroupId` in state before attempting profile creation. The retry button should call the profile create API directly, not reset the whole flow.
  - **Where to start:** `OnboardingShell.tsx` — separate the care-group completion callback from the profile create attempt. Store `pendingCareGroupId` and retry the `/api/care-profiles` call on retry.

## Clinical Trials Review — 2026-05-02

### Fixed ✅ (implemented this session)

- [x] **[CRITICAL BUG] Wrong profile served on trials page** — `trials/page.tsx:12` — `.limit(1)` without `ORDER BY` returned arbitrary profile for users with multiple profiles. Fixed: added `.orderBy(desc(careProfiles.createdAt))`. Same pattern existed in onboarding gate.
- [x] **[BUG] Share button sent empty email when trialUrl is null** — `TrialsTab.tsx:shareTrial` — `props.trialUrl ?? ''` produced a malformed mailto body "I found this trial, can we discuss? ". Fixed: fallback to `https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/${nctId}`.
- [x] **[DESIGN/CRITICAL] CloseMatchCard was entirely light-mode** — `CloseMatchCard.tsx` — `bg-purple-50/30`, `border-purple-200`, `text-blue-700`, `text-gray-500` throughout. Rendered as a white card island inside the dark app — completely broken on the dark theme. Migrated all colors to design system tokens (`var(--border)`, `var(--bg-card)`, `var(--text)`, `var(--text-muted)`, `var(--text-secondary)`) and indigo/violet accent palette.
- [x] **[DESIGN/CRITICAL] TrialDetailPanel was entirely light-mode** — `TrialDetailPanel.tsx` — Every color used raw Tailwind light classes (`gray-50`, `gray-500`, `gray-700`, `blue-600`, `green-100`, etc). Full dark-theme migration: all grays → CSS tokens, blue links → `#A78BFA`, green badges → `emerald-500/15`, save button → `#6366F1`, CopyButton → dark-bordered.
- [x] **[PERF] TrialDetailPanel re-fetched on every expand** — `TrialDetailPanel.tsx` — Each expand/collapse fired a new POST + AI call. Added module-level `Map` cache keyed by `nctId`; result stored on first fetch and reused on all subsequent expands.
- [x] **[A11Y] Error messages not announced to screen readers** — `ProfileDataPrompt`, `ZipCodePrompt`, `TrialsTab` — All error `<p>` elements lacked `role="alert"`. Added `role="alert"` + `aria-describedby` linking to error IDs.
- [x] **[A11Y] Form labels not programmatically linked to inputs** — `ProfileDataPrompt.tsx` — Cancer type, stage, and age inputs had visual labels but no `id`/`htmlFor` pairing. Added `useId()` for each field pair.
- [x] **[A11Y] Loading overlay had no screen reader announcement** — `TrialsTab.tsx:liveRunning` — Fixed fullscreen overlay with `role="status"` and `aria-label={SEARCH_PHASES[livePhase]}`. Rotating phase text is now read aloud.
- [x] **[A11Y] Trial results area had no live region** — `TrialsTab.tsx` — When live search completed, screen reader got no announcement that results changed. Added `aria-live="polite"` on the results container.
- [x] **[A11Y] TrialMatchCard title button had no descriptive aria-label** — `TrialMatchCard.tsx:46` — Button text was just the trial title with no context that it expands. Added `aria-label="{title} — expand trial details"` + `aria-expanded`.
- [x] **[A11Y] Expand/collapse chevron buttons lacked context** — `TrialMatchCard.tsx:58` — `aria-label="Expand"` existed but `aria-expanded` was missing. Now both the title button and chevron button carry `aria-expanded`.
- [x] **[A11Y] Loading spinner used emoji** — `TrialDetailPanel.tsx:145` — `⏳` announced as "hourglass" to screen readers. Replaced with CSS spinner + `aria-busy="true"` on container + `aria-live="polite"`.
- [x] **[UX] Initial load showed plain text instead of skeleton** — `TrialsTab.tsx:183` — "Loading trial matches…" with no animation. Replaced with animated `TrialsSkeleton` component matching real layout (header, 2 cards with match reasons and action buttons).
- [x] **[UX] Save trial had no inline confirmation** — `TrialDetailPanel.tsx` — After clicking "Save & track this trial", nothing confirmed the save happened. Added `justSaved` state with 3-second inline "✓ Saved — we'll notify you if this trial's status changes" message.
- [x] **[COPY] Microcopy rewrites — clinical → warm** — All 5 components — Rewrote 15+ copy strings to feel appropriate for cancer patients and caregivers. Key changes: "Tell us about the patient" → "Let's find the right trials", "No matching trials found" → "We didn't find a match right now — but trials open every week", "Trials You're Close To" → "Almost There — Trials Worth Watching", "What's blocking eligibility" → "What would need to change", empty state copy now offers next steps and reassurance, zip prompt now explains why it's being asked.
- [x] **[COPY] 'Close match' badge changed to 'Almost there'** — `CloseMatchCard.tsx` — "Close match" badge was clinical and ambiguous. Changed to "Almost there" which is warmer and clearer about meaning.
- [x] **[A11Y] Section elements given aria-label** — `TrialsTab.tsx` — Matched trials and close match sections now have `aria-label` for screen reader navigation. Page wrapper upgraded from `div` to `main`.
- [x] **[A11Y] ZipCodePrompt sr-only label added** — `ZipCodePrompt.tsx` — Input had no visible label (just placeholder). Added `<label className="sr-only">` so screen readers still get a label, and `aria-invalid` on error state.

### Deferred (TODO)

- [ ] **[A11Y] No skip navigation on trials page** — Users must tab through all buttons on every trial card to reach the next card. On a page with 10+ trials (3 buttons each = 30+ tabs), this is painful.
  - **Why:** WCAG 2.4.1 (Level A) requires a way to bypass repeating blocks of content.
  - **Fix:** Add `<a href="#trial-results" className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">Skip to results</a>` at the top of the page. Set `id="trial-results"` on the results region.
  - **Where to start:** `TrialsTab.tsx` — add skip link before main content, apply `id` to results div.

- [ ] **[A11Y] Color contrast audit needed on score badges** — `TrialMatchCard.tsx:ScoreBadge` — `text-emerald-400 bg-emerald-500/15` and `text-indigo-300 bg-indigo-500/15` on dark card backgrounds. Emerald-400 (#34D399) on `rgba(16,185,129,0.15)` over `#0C0E1A` composite may be marginal at small text sizes. Needs a real contrast audit with a tool like axe DevTools.
  - **Fix if failing:** Bump text to `text-emerald-300` / `text-indigo-200` for higher contrast.

- [ ] **[UX] No notification hook when "close match" becomes eligible** — `CloseMatchCard` explains "We're watching them for you" but there's no actual mechanism to re-check and notify. The cron at `/api/cron/trials-status` may handle status updates but not re-scoring for eligibility changes.
  - **Why:** This is the most valuable feature for "close" matches — telling a patient when they cross a threshold.
  - **Where to start:** `matchingQueue.ts` — add a re-score job for profiles with close matches after lab values update.

- [ ] **[UX] TrialsDashboardCard not reviewed** — The dashboard card linking to trials was not part of this review. Visual consistency with updated CloseMatchCard dark theme should be verified.
  - **Where to start:** `TrialsDashboardCard.tsx` — check for same light-mode color patterns.

- [ ] **[MISSING] Saved trials view** — Users can save trials but there's no dedicated view to see all saved trials in one place. The "interested" status is stored in DB but only visible per-card on the main trials page.
  - **Why:** Patients actively tracking multiple trials need to compare them, share them with oncologists, and monitor status changes in one place.
  - **Where to start:** `/api/trials/saved` already returns all saved trials. Add a "Saved" filter/tab to `TrialsTab` or a `/trials/saved` route.

- [ ] **[MISSING] Trial comparison feature** — No way to compare two or three trials side-by-side (phase, location, eligibility gaps, enrollment status). Cancer patients and oncologists making trial decisions need this.
  - **Effort:** Human ~1 week / CC ~30min. High value, significant scope.

## Dashboard Flow Review — 2026-05-02

### Fixed ✅ (implemented this session)

- [x] **[BUG] Lab high/low direction always said "Above normal"** — `DashboardView.tsx:262` — All abnormal labs showed "Above normal" regardless of direction. For chemo patients with critically low WBC, hemoglobin, or platelets this was actively wrong. Fix: compute `labDirection` from `parseLabValue` min/max, show "Below normal" when `numericValue < referenceMin`.
- [x] **[COPY] Empty state was cold/clinical** — `DashboardView.tsx:447` — "Nothing needs attention" / "No items need your attention right now." for cancer patients seeing a clear dashboard. Changed to "You're all caught up" / "Nothing urgent right now — take a breath." and "Let's personalize your care" for new users.
- [x] **[COPY] "Unknown doctor" on medication refill card** — `DashboardView.tsx:169` — Changed to "Your care team" which is warmer and still accurate.
- [x] **[COPY] "Weekly update unavailable." error was cold** — `DashboardView.tsx:648` — Changed to "Couldn't load this week's update." Also fixed retry button to re-fetch just that section instead of `window.location.reload()`.
- [x] **[UX] Quick-ask chips hidden when no alerts** — `DashboardView.tsx:548` — Users who had nothing urgent (the best possible state) saw no quick-ask entry point. Removed `actionCount > 0` gate — chips always visible. Removed duplicate empty-state tour tooltip.
- [x] **[A11Y] ExpandableCard focus ring invisible** — `ExpandableCard.tsx:69` — `outline: none` with no replacement. Keyboard users had zero visual feedback on focus. Replaced with `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-[#6366F1]`.
- [x] **[A11Y] DashboardInsights tabpanel missing aria-labelledby** — `DashboardInsights.tsx` — `role="tabpanel"` div had no `aria-labelledby` connecting it to the active tab. Added `id` to each tab button and `aria-labelledby={insights-tab-${activeTab}}` to the panel.
- [x] **[A11Y] Get Directions link missing accessible new-tab warning** — `DashboardView.tsx:228` — Opens Google Maps in new tab with no accessible label. Added `aria-label="Get directions to {location} (opens in Maps)"`.
- [x] **[PERF/UX] DashboardSkeleton didn't match real layout** — `DashboardSkeleton.tsx` — Suspense fallback showed 3 plain bars; real layout has 10+ sections. Major layout shift on load. Updated skeleton to approximate real layout: morning card, heading, badges, 3 priority cards, quick-ask chips, timeline shortcut, check-in card.
- [x] **[COPY] Lab first insight always said "above the normal range"** — `DashboardView.tsx:291` — Now uses `labDirection` variable: "above the normal range" or "below the normal range". Changed "Schedule a follow-up" to "It's worth discussing this with your care team" — warmer for patients.

### Design fixes ✅ (implemented this session)

- [x] **[A11Y/CONTRAST] DashboardInsights inactive tabs failed WCAG AA** — `DashboardInsights.tsx:40` — `--text-muted` (#5B6785) on dark background = 3.4:1 contrast at 12px (needs 4.5:1). Changed to `--text-secondary` (#A5B4CF = 9.2:1).
- [x] **[A11Y/CONTRAST] DashboardInsights section header low contrast** — `DashboardInsights.tsx:23` — Same `--text-muted` issue on "Insights" section label. Changed to `--text-secondary`.
- [x] **[A11Y/CONTRAST] Quick Ask section label low contrast** — `DashboardView.tsx` — "Quick Ask" uppercase label used `--text-muted`. Changed to `--text-secondary`.
- [x] **[DESIGN] Emoji as design element in MorningSummaryCard** — `MorningSummaryCard.tsx:51` — "☀️ YOUR DAY" used emoji as header decoration (AI design slop pattern). Removed emoji, kept clean "YOUR DAY" label.
- [x] **[COPY/DESIGN] Redundant "Get Started" label in empty state** — `DashboardView.tsx:471` — "Get Started" uppercase section label appeared directly below the heading "Let's personalize your care" — redundant and diluted hierarchy. Removed.

### Deferred (TODO)

- [ ] **[UX] Dashboard has no manual refresh** — Data is stale from server render. No refresh button or stale-data indicator. Users editing meds/appointments don't see updates without a full page reload. Suggested: router.refresh() button in the header, or optimistic updates from child forms.
  - **Why:** Users frequently add appointments/meds then return to dashboard expecting updated counts.
  - **Where to start:** `DashboardView.tsx` — add a refresh icon button near the action count heading that calls `router.refresh()`.

- [ ] **[UX] Medication adherence streak missing from dashboard** — No sense of continuity for patients managing daily meds. The check-in card shows mood/pain but not "You've taken your meds 7 days in a row."
  - **Why:** Streak/consistency signals are motivating for patients in active treatment and help caregivers confirm compliance.
  - **Where to start:** `reminderLogs` table already tracks scheduled vs completed. Compute streak in dashboard page query, pass to a new `MedStreakBadge` component.

- [ ] **[A11Y] ExpandableCard `aria-label` missing context** — Screen readers announce `role="button" aria-expanded="false"` with no description of what the card is. Users tabbing through cards hear "button, collapsed" with no indication of content type (medication refill, appointment, lab alert).
  - **Why:** WCAG 2.1 AA requires interactive elements have descriptive accessible names.
  - **Fix:** Pass `aria-label` prop through `ExpandableCard` → composed from card title + type, e.g. "Medication refill alert for Metformin, expand for action steps".

- [ ] **[UX] MorningSummaryCard dismiss has no animation** — Card just disappears. On a page meant to feel premium for people managing a cancer journey, every interaction should feel considered.
  - **Fix:** Add exit animation (fade + slight upward translate) using CSS transition on a wrapper div with a conditional `opacity-0 -translate-y-2` class.

- [ ] **[UX] DashboardInsights tabs — no loading state on switch** — Switching between Lab Trends / Refills / Wellness briefly shows empty content while child components fetch their data. Users see a flash of blank space.
  - **Fix:** Add a `Suspense` boundary around each tab panel content with a small skeleton.

- [ ] **[COPY] Onboarding "Finish setting up your profile" banner** — `DashboardView.tsx:691` — "Add your diagnosis, medications, and priorities for a personalized experience" is OK but generic. Could be: "Tell us about [patientName]'s diagnosis so we can show relevant trials, alerts, and care tips."
  - **Why:** Connecting the CTA to concrete outcomes (trials, alerts) drives completion. Uses the patient's name to make it personal.

- [ ] **[COPY] Treatment phase badge "Evaluating"** — `DashboardView.tsx:44` — For `treatmentPhase: 'unsure'`, badge shows "Evaluating." This could feel isolating — many patients feel scared about being in an uncertain phase. Consider "Getting Answers" which frames uncertainty as an active process.

- [ ] **[PERF] Two DB user lookups per dashboard page load** — `layout.tsx` and `dashboard/page.tsx` both query `users` by email on every request. One query should be eliminated by sharing user context via server component prop drilling or a shared data-fetch utility.
  - **Why:** Aurora Serverless cold starts amplify this — two serial queries on first load. (Prior learning: `aurora-cold-start-uuid-type-error`)
  - **Where to start:** Pass `dbUser` from `AppLayout` down through props or use React `cache()` to deduplicate within a single request.

- [ ] **[A11Y] Tour tooltip has no focus management** — When `showTourTooltip` becomes true, focus stays on whatever was last focused. Screen reader users don't know the tooltip appeared. Should use `aria-live="polite"` on a visually hidden announcement, or move focus to the tooltip with a `useEffect`.

---

## Chat AI Flow Review — 2026-05-02

### Fixed ✅ (implemented this session)

- [x] **[BUG/DESIGN] TypingIndicator was light-mode** — `TypingIndicator.tsx` — `bg-slate-100` + `bg-slate-400` dots rendered as a white/gray box inside the dark app — completely broken. Migrated to match AI message bubble: `bg-white/[0.06] border border-white/[0.08]` container, `bg-[#A78BFA]` dots, AI avatar added for layout consistency. Added `role="status"` + `aria-label="CareCompanion is thinking"`.
- [x] **[SECURITY] CSRF validation missing on POST /api/chat** — `app/api/chat/route.ts` — Client sent `x-csrf-token` header via `DefaultChatTransport` but server never called `validateCsrf()`. Missed in commit d7ef525. Added `validateCsrf(req)` after user rate limit check.
- [x] **[BUG] Model slug used hyphens for version** — `app/api/chat/route.ts:54,219` — `claude-sonnet-4-6` → `claude-sonnet-4.6` (SDK requires dot notation).
- [x] **[UX/BUG] New Chat only cleared client state** — `ChatInterface.tsx:handleNewChat` — `setMessages([])` cleared the UI but DB messages persisted; refreshing brought them all back. Added two-click confirmation (turns red, "Confirm?", auto-cancels after 3s) + calls `DELETE /api/chat/history` on confirm.
- [x] **[COPY] Empty state heading generic** — `ChatInterface.tsx:206` — "Hi, how can I help?" is wrong for cancer patients. Changed to "Hi, I'm here for you." with subtext "Ask me anything — managing side effects, understanding your labs, or preparing for your next appointment."
- [x] **[COPY] Error banner was cold/clinical** — `ChatInterface.tsx` — "Something went wrong." + "Retry" is too blunt for vulnerable users. Changed to "Having trouble connecting. You can try again below." + "Try again". Added `role="alert"` + `aria-live="assertive"`.
- [x] **[A11Y] Messages region had no ARIA role** — `ChatInterface.tsx:184` — Scrollable container had no `role="log"`, `aria-label`, or `aria-live`. Added `role="log" aria-label="Conversation" aria-live="polite"`.
- [x] **[A11Y] Chat input had no accessible label** — `ChatInterface.tsx:313` — Input used placeholder only. Added `aria-label="Message CareCompanion AI"`. Updated placeholder to warmer copy.
- [x] **[A11Y] Send/stop/voice buttons relied on title only** — `ChatInterface.tsx` — `title` is tooltip-only. Added `aria-label` to send ("Send message"), stop ("Stop response"), voice ("Start/Stop voice input").
- [x] **[UX/DESIGN] Copy button added to AI responses** — `MessageBubble.tsx` — No way to copy medical info. Added clipboard copy button (hover-visible, 2s "Copied!" confirmation).
- [x] **[CODE] AI SDK v6 tool part type** — `MessageBubble.tsx:80,105` — `'tool-invocation'` removed in v6. Updated filter to `type.startsWith('tool-')`. Tool pending copy: "Working on it…" → "Looking up your information…" with `role="status"`.

### Deferred (TODO)

- [ ] **[UX] No message history pagination** — `chat/page.tsx` always loads last 50 messages. History API already supports `before` cursor pagination but nothing uses it. Long-term patients lose older messages.
  - **Why:** Patients in extended treatment accumulate months of conversation context that can't be accessed.
  - **Fix:** Add "Load earlier messages" button at scroll top calling `GET /api/chat/history?before={timestamp}&limit=20`.
  - **Where to start:** `ChatInterface.tsx` — add `loadMore` state + button + fetch.

- [ ] **[MISSING] Export conversation as PDF** — No way to share AI conversation with oncologist. Cancer patients want to bring AI-prepared summaries to appointments.
  - **Why:** High-value touchpoint — AI-assisted appointment prep is a core use case.
  - **Effort:** Human ~3 days / CC ~20 min. Use `@react-pdf/renderer` or server-side Puppeteer.
  - **Where to start:** Add "Export" button in header → `GET /api/chat/export?format=pdf`.

- [ ] **[A11Y] No skip navigation in chat** — Keyboard users must tab through header buttons before reaching the input. WCAG 2.4.1 Level A.
  - **Fix:** Add `<a href="#chat-input" className="sr-only focus:not-sr-only">Skip to message input</a>` at top of `ChatInterface`. Add `id="chat-input"` to input.
  - **Where to start:** `ChatInterface.tsx` — two lines.

- [ ] **[UX] Markdown doesn't handle multi-line code blocks** — `MessageBubble.tsx:renderMarkdown` — Only handles single-line fences. Multi-line blocks (lab tables, JSON) render as garbled text with backticks.
  - **Fix:** Rewrite `renderMarkdown` with block-level state machine, or swap in `react-markdown`.
  - **Where to start:** `MessageBubble.tsx:renderMarkdown`.

- [ ] **[UX] Guest chat page a11y parity** — Guest chat (`/chat/guest`) has same gaps as main chat before today's fixes (no `role="log"`, no input `aria-label`, cold error copy).
  - **Where to start:** `apps/web/src/app/chat/guest/page.tsx` — apply same pattern as `ChatInterface.tsx` fixes above.

- [ ] **[A11Y] Color contrast on starter prompt icons needs audit** — Icon colors (`#A78BFA`, `#34D399`, `#60A5FA`, `#F472B6`) at 20% opacity on dark card may not meet WCAG AA at small sizes.
  - **Where to start:** Run axe DevTools on `/chat` empty state, fix by bumping icon opacity to 40%+ if failing.

## Integrations Audit — 2026-05-02 (all fixed ✅)

Full audit: Google Calendar OAuth, HealthKit sync, connected apps management, disconnect/revoke, token refresh, error handling.

- [x] **[CRITICAL] `decryptToken` missing — Google Calendar sync always 401** — `token-encryption.ts` — `encryptToken` stored tokens as `enc:v1:...` but no decrypt function existed. Sync route passed the encrypted string as a Bearer token to Google API; every Calendar API call failed with 401. Added `decryptToken()` using AES-256-GCM and applied it at `sync/google-calendar/route.ts:45,56`.

- [x] **[CRITICAL] Token refresh stored plaintext after decrypt** — `sync/google-calendar/route.ts:67` — After a successful token refresh, the new `access_token` (plaintext from Google) was written to DB without re-encrypting. Next refresh attempt would call `decryptToken()` on a plaintext string, bypassing the `enc:v1:` prefix check. Fixed: wrap with `encryptToken()` before the DB update.

- [x] **[CRITICAL] Initial post-OAuth sync always failed (CSRF deadlock)** — `sync/google-calendar/route.ts:8` — OAuth callback called sync route server-side with `x-internal-secret`. CSRF check ran first (before auth check) and rejected all server-side calls with 403 — so the initial calendar import never ran after connecting. Fixed: check `x-internal-secret` before CSRF; skip CSRF for validated internal calls only.

- [x] **[CRITICAL] Calendar dedup matched on event title only** — `sync/google-calendar/route.ts:116` — Dedup query matched `doctorName = event.summary` with no date check. Recurring events (e.g. weekly "Doctor checkup") all share the same summary — only the first occurrence was ever imported; all later dates silently skipped. Fixed: added `dateTime` to dedup `WHERE` clause using `eq(appointments.dateTime, dateTime)` + `isNull` fallback for all-day events.

- [x] **[SECURITY] `signState` silently unsigned in production** — `token-encryption.ts:88` — If `OAUTH_STATE_SECRET` env var was missing in production, `signState()` only logged a warning and returned unsigned state. OAuth CSRF protection was completely absent without any visible failure. Changed `console.warn` → `throw Error` so a missing secret hard-fails instead of silently degrading.

- [x] **[SECURITY] `/api/sync/status` leaked encrypted access/refresh tokens to client** — `sync/status/route.ts:11` — `db.select()` without column projection returned full rows including `accessToken` and `refreshToken` fields (encrypted but still sensitive). Fixed: explicit column selection — `id`, `source`, `lastSynced`, `expiresAt`, `createdAt`, `metadata` only.

- [x] **[SECURITY] Sync route IDOR — `user_id` in body not validated for browser callers** — `sync/google-calendar/route.ts` — Previous code checked session ownership only when a session existed; unauthenticated paths fell through to the internal-secret branch. Restructured: browser callers always go through session auth; `user_id` body param is optional and overridden by session (prevents IDOR); internal calls bypass session only.

- [x] **[MISSING] No disconnect/revoke endpoint** — No API route existed to remove a connected app. Users had no way to revoke Google Calendar access. Created `DELETE /api/integrations/[source]/route.ts` — validates CSRF, verifies session ownership, deletes the `connectedApps` row, writes audit log.

- [x] **[MISSING] No Integrations UI in Settings** — `SettingsPage.tsx` had no section for connected apps. Users couldn't connect, disconnect, or sync Google Calendar from the web app. Added full Integrations section: connect button for unauthenticated state, sync + disconnect buttons for connected state, last-synced timestamp, expired-token warning banner, Apple Health (informational — iOS only).

- [x] **[MISSING] Re-auth flow on token expiry** — When `expiresAt` is in the past (expired token, no refresh), the UI now shows an orange "Token expired — reconnect to resume syncing" warning. `handleSyncGoogle` also catches `reconnect` in the error message and shows a specific toast prompting the user to reconnect.

- [x] **[BUG] `handleSyncGoogle` sent connectedApp row ID as `user_id`** — `SettingsPage.tsx` — Sync call sent `user_id: googleCalendar?.id` (the UUID of the `connectedApps` row) not the user's ID. Fixed the sync route to derive `user_id` from session when called from a browser; frontend no longer sends `user_id`.

- [x] **[DEAD CODE] `TimelineEvent` unused re-export** — `TreatmentTimeline.tsx:16` — `export type { TimelineEvent }` re-exported a type no external consumer imported. Removed.

- [x] **[DEAD CODE] `CheckinInput` unused export** — `checkin-validation.ts:11` — Type exported but imported nowhere outside the file. Changed to local `type`.

- [x] **[DEAD CODE] `EligibilityGap` unused re-export** — `gapAnalysis.ts:3` — Re-exported from `assembleProfile` but no consumer imported it from `gapAnalysis`. Removed re-export line.

- [x] **[DEAD CODE] `babel.config.js` + `babel-preset-expo`** — `apps/mobile/` — Config file and its package were unused (Expo no longer needs explicit Babel config). Deleted `babel.config.js`, removed `babel-preset-expo` from `package.json`.

---

## Chat AI & Notifications Audit — 2026-05-02 (all fixed ✅)

Full plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-02-chat-notifications-audit.md`

- [x] **[SECURITY] CSRF missing in NotificationsView dismiss/markAllRead** — `NotificationsView.tsx:60,73` — POST to `/api/notifications/read` lacked `x-csrf-token` header; backend rejected all calls. Added CSRF header + error rollback.
- [x] **[SECURITY] CSRF missing in NotificationBell dismiss/markAllRead** — `NotificationBell.tsx:88,99` — Same missing header; silent failures. Added CSRF header + rollback.
- [x] **[BUG] "Ask AI" prompt never auto-sent from NotificationsView** — `NotificationsView.tsx:145` — Used `"Tell me more about: {title}"` which doesn't match `isAllowedPrompt()`. Changed to type-based prompts (`"Help me manage my medication refills"` etc) that all match allowlist.
- [x] **[BUG] getChatPrompt() patterns in NotificationBell didn't match allowlist** — `NotificationBell.tsx:36-55` — Prompts like `"Explain this lab result: {title}"` never auto-sent. Replaced all with type-based allowlist-compatible patterns.
- [x] **[SECURITY] PHI in chat URL params from notification links** — `NotificationsView.tsx:145`, `NotificationBell.tsx:162` — Notification titles (med names, lab values) were URL-encoded into `?prompt=`. Removed titles from URLs; now use generic type prompts.
- [x] **[BUG] Soft-deleted medications/appointments generated spurious notifications** — `notifications.ts:84,87` — Missing `isNull(deletedAt)` filters. Added to both queries.
- [x] **[BUG] markAllRead shows success toast on API failure** — `NotificationsView.tsx:71-79` — No `res.ok` check. Fixed: rollback state and show error toast on failure.
- [x] **[BUG] NotificationBell dismiss had no error handling** — `NotificationBell.tsx:85-93` — Notification disappeared from UI but wasn't marked read on failure. Added rollback.
- [x] **[RELIABILITY] generateNotificationsForAllUsers timed out for large user bases** — `notifications.ts:371-376` — Serial loop failed at 120+ users (Vercel 60s cron limit). Replaced with batched `Promise.allSettled` (10 parallel).
- [x] **[BUG] Orchestrator rate limiter created new instance per request** — `orchestrator.ts:54` — `rateLimit()` called inside function body; per-process state never shared. Moved to module scope.
- [x] **[BUG] Orchestrator polluted memories table with system telemetry** — `orchestrator.ts:131-143` — Multi-agent queries logged as `category: 'other'` memory facts; memory extraction LLM then "saw" these as patient facts. Removed the insert block.

---

## P0 — Critical (breaks core user flow or clinical integrity)

- [x] **[QA] Silent fetch swallow on trials mount** — `TrialsTab.tsx:112` — `.catch(() => {})` on both `/api/trials/matches` and `/api/trials/saved` fetch errors. User sees empty tab with no error and no retry. Fix: catch, set error state, render error banner with retry button.

- [x] **[QA] `isCloseTrial` override misclassifies high-scoring matched trials** — `clinicalTrialsAgent.ts:109` — Claude scores a trial 95/100 as `'matched'` but `isCloseTrial` downgrade fires if any gap exists, reclassifying it to `'close'`. Fix: only apply `isCloseTrial` as fallback when `rawCat` is neither `'matched'` nor `'close'`, not on all matched results.

- [x] **[QA] Concurrent `runLive` race condition** — `TrialsTab.tsx:116-132` — `ProfileDataPrompt.onSaved` calls `void runLive()` while button-click can trigger a second concurrent POST. Two calls race; second overwrites state non-deterministically. Fix: add `useRef` guard or check `liveRunning` before entering `runLive`.

- [x] **[DESIGN] TrialMatchCard is a light-mode component in a dark app** — `TrialMatchCard.tsx:27-129` — All color tokens (`bg-white`, `text-gray-500`, `bg-green-100`, `bg-blue-600`, `border-gray-300`) are wrong for the dark design system. Every matched trial card renders broken. Fix: rewrite using `bg-[var(--bg-card)]`, `text-[var(--text)]`, Trust Indigo CTAs, and design system semantic colors throughout.

---

## P1 — High (degrades UX, misleads user, or violates design principles)

- [x] **[QA] `hasSearched` not set on `runLive` failure** — `TrialsTab.tsx:309-327` — After a failed live search (`liveError` set), `hasSearched` stays `false`. Empty state reads "Click Find trials now to search" directly below the error banner. Contradictory. Fix: set `hasSearched = true` in the catch block.

- [x] **[QA] Stale threshold 90 days is clinically misleading** — `matches/route.ts:20` — Trial enrollment status changes frequently; an 89-day-old result shows as fresh. Fix: lower to 30 days or show "last checked" label on every result regardless of stale flag.

- [x] **[QA] New user "All clear!" identical to onboarded user with no alerts** — `DashboardView.tsx:437-444` — New user with 0 data sees same green checkmark and "All clear!" as an onboarded user with nothing urgent. Fix: gate "All clear" on `onboardingComplete && (medications.length > 0 || appointments.length > 0)`. Show "Get started" heading for new users.

- [x] **[QA] `searchByEligibility` is a duplicate search** — `clinicalTrialsAgent.ts:38-39` — Function passes `age` but `tools.ts` ignores it; calls same CT.gov endpoint as broad search. Deduplication on line 51 collapses any benefit. Fix: pass age/sex as `query.term` to CT.gov or remove the duplicate call and use one search with `pageSize: 40`.

- [x] **[DESIGN] Hero metric grid in Analytics tab** — `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx:96-111` — Three identical centered stat cards with `text-2xl font-bold` numbers over `text-[10px] uppercase` labels — textbook AI slop hero metric template. Fix: remove grid; fold adherence rate inline into the adherence section below it.

- [x] **[DESIGN] Gradient CTAs throughout** — `DashboardView.tsx:183`, `DashboardView.tsx:595-617`, `TrialsTab.tsx:245` — `bg-gradient-to-r from-[#6366F1] to-[#A78BFA]` used on multiple buttons. DESIGN.md prohibits gradient fills outside primary button. Fix: replace all with solid `bg-[#6366F1] hover:bg-[#4F46E5]`.

- [x] **[DESIGN] Celebratory/gamified microcopy** — `DashboardView.tsx:419`, `ProfileCompleteness.tsx:309` — "Looking good!" on empty dashboard, "Profile complete!" with exclamation. Wrong emotional register for cancer caregivers. Fix: `"[name]'s care is up to date."` / `"Profile complete"` (no exclamation).

- [x] **[DESIGN] All symptom pills styled as alerts** — `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx:182` — `bg-red-500/10 text-red-400` applied to every reported symptom regardless of severity. Fatigue appears as alarming as a critical lab. Fix: use neutral `bg-white/[0.06] text-[var(--text-secondary)]`; reserve red for clinically flagged symptoms only.

- [x] **[ENG] weeklyUpdate error buried below fold** — `DashboardView.tsx:636-638` — Error state renders as small muted text after all action cards. No retry affordance. Fix: show error inline where the card would appear, with a retry button.

---

## P2 — Medium (polish, accessibility, consistency)

- [x] **[QA] `trialUrl` empty string instead of null** — `clinicalTrialsAgent.ts:123` — `String(t.url ?? '')` writes `""` to DB when LLM omits url; TrialMatchCard renders a broken empty anchor. Fix: `t.url ? String(t.url) : null`.

- [x] **[QA] Trials mount fetch has no timeout** — `TrialsTab.tsx:89-113` — If either fetch never resolves (network hang), spinner shows indefinitely. Fix: add `AbortController` with 10s timeout.

- [x] **[DESIGN] `text-[10px]` throughout** — `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx:99,103,109`, `PriorityCard.tsx:77` — Below WCAG AA minimum for body text. Fix: bump all to `text-xs` (12px) minimum.

- [x] **[DESIGN] Hardcoded hex instead of CSS vars** — `DashboardView.tsx:450,540`, `TrialsTab.tsx:166,245` — `text-[#64748b]`, gradient inline styles bypass the design token system. Fix: replace with `text-[var(--text-muted)]` and `bg-[#6366F1]` Tailwind classes.

- [x] **[DESIGN] Emoji in clinical data** — `TrialMatchCard.tsx:101` — `📍` for location is inaccessible and tone-inappropriate. Fix: SVG pin icon with `aria-hidden="true"` + visible text.

- [x] **[DESIGN] Trials loading overlay uses off-token background** — `TrialsTab.tsx:166` — `linear-gradient(135deg, #0a0814 0%, #110d24 100%)` diverges from design token `#0C0E1A`. Fix: `bg-[#0C0E1A]`.

- [x] **[ENG] Lab trend direction has no direction-semantics field** — `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx:215-219` — `↑`/`↓` are now neutral (fixed this session) but there's no `directionIsGood` field on `LabResult` type. Future dev could re-introduce red/green. Fix: add `directionIsGood: boolean | null` to `LabResult` schema and Aurora table.

- [x] **[DESIGN] `"Profile complete"` exclamation and `"Your care team has everything they need."` copy** — `ProfileCompleteness.tsx:309` — Remove exclamation. Keep supporting copy.

---

## Auth Audit — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

- [x] **[AUTH] `consent/accept` used email instead of user ID** — `consent/accept/route.ts:27` — `eq(users.email, session.user.email!)` silently fails for Apple users where email may be null. Fixed to `eq(users.id, session.user.id)`.

- [x] **[AUTH] Open redirect via `//evil.com` callbackUrl** — `middleware.ts:90` — `cb.startsWith('/')` allows `//evil.com`. Fixed: added `!cb.startsWith('//')` guard.

- [x] **[AUTH] No rate limiting on `/api/auth/register`** — `register/route.ts` — attacker could create unlimited accounts. Fixed: 5 registrations/hour per IP.

- [x] **[AUTH] `set-role` session update used raw fetch with no error check** — `set-role/page.tsx` — `fetch('/api/auth/session', {})` not checked for failure; could leave JWT stale (role=null), causing middleware to redirect back to `/set-role` loop. Fixed: use `useSession().update()` from `next-auth/react`; check result before navigating.

- [x] **[AUTH] Hardcoded personal email in debug-auth** — `debug-auth/route.ts:13` — `'aryan.motgi1@gmail.com'` as default. Fixed: require `?email=` param; removed from `PUBLIC_PATHS`.

- [ ] **[AUTH] `pending_role` cookie dead code** — `auth.ts:94-104` — Cookie never set by any web UI. New Google/Apple users correctly land on `/set-role` via middleware redirect. Safe to remove the cookie-check branch when cleaning up.

- [ ] **[AUTH] Consent redirect loses original destination** — `consent/page.tsx:37` — Always redirects to `/dashboard` after acceptance. Store original URL in `sessionStorage` before consent redirect; restore after.

- [ ] **[AUTH] `debug-auth` route should be deleted** — `app/api/debug-auth/route.ts` — Marked TEMP. Self-gates on `NODE_ENV !== 'development'`. Delete when no longer needed.

- [ ] **[AUTH] Care group login lacks rate limiting** — `auth.ts:46-88` — No brute-force protection on the care-group Credentials provider. Add limiter by groupName.

---

## Onboarding Audit — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

### FIXED

- [x] **[SECURITY] `join/page.tsx` careGroupId URL param not verified against invite** — `join/page.tsx:50` — Attacker could craft `/join?group=VICTIM_GROUP_ID&token=VALID_TOKEN_FOR_DIFFERENT_GROUP` to join any group using any valid token. Fixed: verify `invite.careGroupId === careGroupId` before processing; use `invite.careGroupId` (not URL param) for all member inserts.

- [x] **[SECURITY] `POST /api/onboarding/complete` no ownership check on careProfileId** — `onboarding/complete/route.ts:16` — Any authenticated user could mark any care profile as `onboardingCompleted: true` by sending a foreign `careProfileId`. Fixed: look up `dbUser` by email and verify `careProfiles.userId === dbUser.id` before update.

- [x] **[BUG] PatientWizard manual entry: medications and appointment never saved** — `PatientWizard.tsx:201` — `manualMeds` (array of 3 inputs) and `manualAppt` (date) collected but excluded from `patchProfile` call. Only `manualDiagnosis` was saved. Fixed: filter non-empty `manualMeds`, join as comma-separated text, save to `conditions` field with `fieldOverrides.conditions=true`. (Note: `nextAppointment` has no column in `careProfiles` — data was unrecoverable per schema; tracked below.)

- [x] **[BUG] Care profile creation failure silently redirects to dashboard → redirect loop** — `OnboardingShell.tsx:119` — When `/api/care-profiles` POST fails or returns no `id`, `wizardProfileId` is `null`; phase-complete fallback fires `window.location.href='/dashboard'`; `AppLayout` finds no completed profile and redirects back to `/onboarding`. Fixed: set `profileCreateError` state on failure; render actionable error with "Try again" instead of redirecting.

- [x] **[BUG] QR polling interval leaks on unmount** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx:79` — `setInterval` (3s) and `setTimeout` (30s) created in `startPolling` never cleared if component unmounts before timeout. Fixed: store refs in `pollingRef`; `useEffect` cleanup clears both on unmount; interval self-cleans on successful join.

### OPEN

- [ ] **[BUG] PatientWizard confirm screen: `nextAppointment` collected but never saved** — `PatientWizard.tsx:140-152` — Confirm screen shows "Next appointment" editable field, user edits it, patchProfile call (line 160) omits it. `careProfiles` has no `nextAppointment` column — needs schema column + PATCH allowlist entry.

- [ ] **[BUG] PatientWizard manual entry: `manualAppt` collected but not saveable** — `PatientWizard.tsx:197` — Same root cause as above. Date input appears but has nowhere to persist until `nextAppointment` column is added.

- [ ] **[BUG] PatientWizard "Connect Apple Health" button is misleading on web** — `PatientWizard.tsx:102` — Button says "Connect Apple Health" but on web it just fetches existing profile data from DB (HealthKit requires the iOS app). Label should read "Check my health data" or "Review profile data". No logic change needed.

- [ ] **[BUG] `self` role treated identically to `patient` in OnboardingWizard** — `OnboardingWizard.tsx:17` — Both go to `PatientWizard`. If `self` users are meant to track their own health proactively (not cancer patients), the caregiver wizard steps about patient name / relationship don't apply. No dedicated `self` wizard path exists — intentional gap or missing feature.

- [ ] **[SECURITY] `POST /api/auth/set-role`, `/api/care-group`, `/api/care-group/join`, `/api/onboarding/complete` have no CSRF token check** — Unlike `consent/accept` which uses `validateCsrf`. Session cookie is `sameSite: lax` so cross-site POSTs from attacker-controlled pages could trigger these on behalf of a victim. Either validate the `cc-csrf-token` header on all mutation endpoints or confirm `sameSite: strict` on session cookie.

- [ ] **[UX] Returning user who visits `/onboarding` re-enters wizard on completed profile** — `OnboardingShell.tsx:48` — If user has a completed profile and navigates to `/onboarding`, phase starts as `'wizard'` and the wizard opens on the completed profile. Should redirect to `/dashboard` or show "You're all set" state.

---

## Dashboard Flow Audit — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

### FIXED

- [x] **[SECURITY] `GET /api/checkins` missing careProfileId ownership check** — `checkins/route.ts:241` — Any authenticated user could read any care profile's check-in data and streak by passing an arbitrary `careProfileId`. Fixed: verify caller owns profile (`careProfiles.userId === dbUser.id`) or is a care team member before returning data.

- [x] **[BUG/HIGH] Energy enum mismatch — `CheckinModal` sends `'med'`, server validates `'medium'`** — `CheckinModal.tsx:22`, `checkin-validation.ts:6` — `ENERGY_OPTIONS = ['low', 'med', 'high']` but server schema is `z.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high'])`. Every check-in with Med energy returned 400 Validation error. Fixed: changed modal value to `'medium'`, display still reads `'Med'`. Also added `med: 2` to `SymptomRadarCard.ENERGY_MAP` for backward compat with any existing DB rows.

- [x] **[BUG] Appointment cards showed past same-day appointments as "Today"** — `DashboardView.tsx:206` — `daysUntil = Math.ceil(...)` rounds negative fractions up to 0, so a 2-hour-past appointment shows as "Today at X". Fixed: added `if (apptDate.getTime() <= now.getTime()) return` guard before the daysUntil check.

- [x] **[BUG] Analytics page `session.user.email!` non-null assertion** — `analytics/page.tsx:15` — Apple Sign-In users can have a null email; the `!` assertion caused DB query with `undefined`, returning no user and silently redirecting. Fixed: added `if (!userEmail) redirect('/login?error=session')` guard.

- [x] **[UX] CheckinCard returned `null` during loading, causing layout shift** — `CheckinCard.tsx:59` — The 200–500ms fetch for today's check-in status rendered nothing, causing the dashboard to jump when the card appeared. Fixed: replaced `null` with an animated skeleton placeholder matching the card's dimensions.

- [x] **[BUG] NotificationsView dismiss not rolled back on API error** — `NotificationsView.tsx:57` — Optimistic removal fired before fetch; on failure the notification was gone from UI but still unread in DB (would reappear on next page load inconsistently). Fixed: snapshot previous state, restore on non-ok response, show toast.

### OPEN

- [ ] **[BUG] MorningSummaryCard `medicationCount` shows total active meds, not today's scheduled** — `DashboardView.tsx:122` — `todayMedCount = medications.filter(m => !m.deletedAt).length` counts all active meds. Morning card shows "Meds: 5 scheduled" but some may be weekly or PRN. Fix: cross-reference with `reminderLogsData` (already fetched in page.tsx) to count today's scheduled reminders, pass as `medicationCount` to `DashboardView`.

- [ ] **[UX] MorningSummaryCard `dismissed: true` default causes pop-in** — `MorningSummaryCard.tsx:21` — Initial state is `true` (hidden); useEffect sets `false` after localStorage check. Users on fast connections see a layout pop on every page load. Fix: render a fixed-height placeholder while `useEffect` hasn't run, or use a CSS `visibility: hidden` approach so space is reserved.

- [ ] **[DEAD CODE] `CheckinModal` milestone overlay never triggers** — `CheckinModal.tsx:67` — Client checks `data.data?.milestone` but the POST `/api/checkins` response never includes `milestone`. `MilestoneCelebration` component is unreachable. Either implement milestone calculation in the API (e.g., streak milestones at 7/30/100 days) or remove the dead branch.

- [ ] **[BUG] `CheckinModal.handleMilestoneClose` hardcodes streak=0** — `CheckinModal.tsx:115` — When milestone closes, calls `onComplete(null, 0)` — streak momentarily shows 0 until `fetchStatus()` corrects it. Fix: once milestone API is implemented, return `streak` in milestone response and pass it through.

- [ ] **[SECURITY] POST-only mutation endpoints missing CSRF check** — Already tracked in Onboarding Audit open items. Applies to `POST /api/checkins` as well — it validates body but has no `validateCsrf` call unlike `notifications/read`.

---

## Adversarial Review — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

### FIXED

- [x] **[SECURITY] `POST /api/onboarding/complete` used `email!` in new ownership-check code** — `onboarding/complete/route.ts:16` — The ownership-check fix that was just applied looked up `dbUser` using `session.user.email!` — the same null-assertion pattern fixed in analytics and consent. Apple Sign-In users get 404 and can never complete onboarding. Fixed: changed to `WHERE id = session.user.id`.

- [x] **[SECURITY] `POST /api/trials/match` had no rate limit** — Any authenticated user could loop this endpoint to drain Anthropic API budget; `maxDuration = 300` and scoring 100 trials per call. Fixed: added `rateLimit({ interval: 3600000, maxRequests: 3 })` per user ID.

- [x] **[BUG] `dismissTrial` had no rollback on API failure** — Trial removed from UI optimistically; fetch error swallowed silently; trial permanently gone until next page load (clinical data loss). Fixed: snapshot arrays before mutation, restore on non-ok response.

- [x] **[SECURITY] `POST /api/onboarding/complete` used `session.user.id` not `dbUser.id` for care group lookup** — Line 36 used the JWT claim, not the DB-resolved ID; care group email may fail for migrated accounts. Fixed: changed to `dbUser.id`.

### OPEN

- [ ] **[SECURITY] In-memory rate limiter per-serverless-instance** — `rate-limit.ts:25` — `buckets = new Map()` is per-function-instance in Vercel serverless. Without Redis env vars, 5-registration limit is not enforced globally across cold starts. Verify `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` are set in Vercel production.

- [ ] **[BUG] `set-role` page: `update()` null check may block valid Apple Sign-In flow** — `set-role/page.tsx:35` — NextAuth `update()` can legitimately return null if the JWT wasn't expired; the `if (!updated)` guard would show an error to users who successfully set their role. Verify behavior with Apple Sign-In in staging.

- [ ] **[BUG] Join page TOCTOU on invite token** — `join/page.tsx:38-64` — `usedBy` check and insert are three separate DB ops with no transaction; two simultaneous joins could both pass the check. Wrap in a transaction or use conditional UPDATE.

- [ ] **[BUG] LLM JSON extraction regex matches wrong array on truncated response** — `clinicalTrialsAgent.ts:76` — Greedy regex picks first `[...]` in response; truncated output silently returns 0 trials. Add logging when fallback fires; test with pre-result example arrays.

- ✅ [L] Chat prompt sends lab value without unit — LabTrends.tsx:297-300

### APPOINTMENTS — Backend + Frontend

- ✅ [H] Field name mismatch: sends `doctorName` (camelCase), API reads `doctor_name` — AppointmentsView.tsx:34
- ⬜ [H] No edit capability — delete + re-add only
- ⬜ [M] No past-date guard on form (no `min` attribute on datetime-local)
- ⬜ [M] UTC ISO string parsed in browser local time — appointment can appear in wrong day
- ⬜ [M] No deduplication — double-tap inserts duplicate appointments

### TREATMENT CYCLES — Backend + Frontend

- ✅ [C] No DELETE endpoint for cycles — [id]/route.ts only has PATCH
- ⬜ [H] Side effects stored in localStorage only — lost on device switch/incognito — TreatmentCycleTracker.tsx:169-186

- ⬜ [M] `isActive` stays true after final cycle completes — route.ts:88-92

### DRUG INTERACTIONS — Backend + Frontend

- ⬜ [C] Severity mismatch: API produces `major/moderate/minor`, component has `critical` key — never reachable — InteractionWarning.tsx:6 + drug-interactions.ts:12
- ⬜ [H] Unhandled rejection if `generateText` throws / `output` undefined — drug-interactions.ts:36,59
- ✅ [H] Soft-deleted meds included in interaction check (missing `isNull(deletedAt)`) — interactions/check/route.ts:44
- ✅ [M] Single-medication LLM call still fires with 0 other meds — route.ts:61-74

### REFILL STATUS — Backend + Frontend

- ✅ [L] Ambiguous JSON shape double-fallback — RefillStatus.tsx:118
- ✅ [L] No "last updated" timestamp on refill card

### MANUAL ENTRY & UPLOAD — Backend + Frontend

- ⬜ [C] No server-side MIME type check — any file type accepted — documents/extract/route.ts:122
- ⬜ [C] File fully buffered BEFORE size check — OOM risk on large uploads — documents/extract/route.ts:56-58,122
- ⬜ [C] Empty form can be submitted with no client-side validation — CategoryUploadCard.tsx:214
- ⬜ [H] No field-level error feedback — only generic "Failed" toast — CategoryUploadCard.tsx:227

## Clinical Trials Full Audit — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

Legend: ✅ Fixed | ⬜ Pending | [C] Critical | [H] High | [M] Med | [L] Low

### REACT / FRONTEND

- ✅ [C] **TrialDetailPanel: fetch() in render body** — `TrialDetailPanel.tsx:115` — Direct `setLoading(true)` + `fetch()` inside render function violates React rules; fires twice per mount in Strict Mode, leaks request on unmount. Fixed: moved to `useEffect` with `cancelled` flag and `[nctId, isCloseMatch]` deps.
- ✅ [H] **saveTrial: no rollback on API error** — `TrialsTab.tsx:140` — Optimistic `setSaved` fired before request; `.catch(()=>{})` swallowed failures. UI showed trial as saved even when save failed. Fixed: snapshot prev state, rollback on `!res?.ok` (mirrors existing dismissTrial pattern).
- ✅ [H] **TrialsTab initial load: `Promise.all` fails both on single fetch error** — `TrialsTab.tsx:92` — If saved-trials fetch threw, trial matches were also discarded and error screen shown even if matches loaded fine. Fixed: `Promise.allSettled` with graceful degradation (saved badges simply absent on failure).
- ✅ [M] **TrialMatchCard: city/state renders "undefined, undefined"** — `TrialMatchCard.tsx:105` — `{nearestSite.city}, {nearestSite.state}` renders literal "undefined, undefined" when CT.gov omits location fields. Fixed: `[city, state].filter(Boolean).join(', ') || 'Location not listed'`.
- ✅ [M] **CloseMatchCard: empty eligibilityGaps renders broken UI** — `CloseMatchCard.tsx:72` — `eligibilityGaps = []` shows "What's blocking eligibility" header with nothing below it. Fixed: added empty-state message.
- ✅ [M] **ContactBlock: dead `href="#"` fallback link** — `TrialDetailPanel.tsx:73` — `<a href="#">visit the trial page directly</a>` navigates nowhere. Fixed: thread `trialUrl` prop through; render external link or plain text.
- ⬜ [M] **TrialDetailPanel uses hardcoded light-theme colors** — `TrialDetailPanel.tsx` throughout — `text-gray-700`, `bg-gray-50`, `border-gray-200` hardcoded against the dark design system. Rest of app uses `var(--text)`, `var(--bg-card)`. Fix: replace with CSS variable equivalents.
- ⬜ [M] **Retry on initial load does full page reload** — `TrialsTab.tsx:178` — "Retry" button calls `window.location.reload()` instead of re-running the fetch function. Fix: extract load logic into a function, call on retry without full reload.
- ✅ [L] **TrialsTab: cancerStage, patientAge, patientName props unused** — `TrialsTab.tsx:37` — Props accepted but never destructured or used inside the component. Fix: either wire them into display hints or remove from Props type.

### BACKEND — SECURITY

- ✅ [H] **No NCT ID validation in 4 API endpoints** — `save/route.ts`, `saved/[nctId]/route.ts`, `[nctId]/route.ts`, `[nctId]/detail/route.ts` — `nctId` accepted as any string; passed directly to CT.gov API and DB queries. Fixed: `/^NCT\d{4,}$/` regex check, returns 400 for invalid IDs.
- ⬜ [M] **LLM prompt injection surface** — `clinicalTrialsAgent.ts:62` — CT.gov trial data embedded raw into Claude prompt via `JSON.stringify`. CT.gov is trusted, but adversarially-crafted trial records could inject instructions. Fix: add system-prompt-level instruction to ignore embedded directives; strip known injection patterns from trial text before embedding.
- ✅ [L] **`/api/trials/matches` category param unvalidated** — `matches/route.ts:14` — `category` query param used in where-clause condition with no enum check. Falls through to "all" for unknown values — functionally OK but leaks query structure in logs. Fix: validate against `['matched', 'close', 'all']` or ignore unknown values explicitly.

### BACKEND — CORRECTNESS

- ✅ [C] **trialMatches schema missing `phase` column** — `schema.ts:582` — `phase` existed in `TrialMatchResult` and in-memory objects but was never persisted to `trial_matches`. Cached results (GET `/api/trials/matches`) always returned `phase: undefined`, showing "Phase N/A" even when phase was known. Fixed: added `phase text` column to schema, updated `upsertTrial` to persist it, created migration `002-trial-matches-phase.sql`.
  - **⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED**: Run `apps/web/src/lib/db/migrations/002-trial-matches-phase.sql` against production DB.
- ✅ [M] **assembleProfile: empty string for missing lab date** — `assembleProfile.ts:119` — `resultDate: l.dateTaken ?? ''` sent blank string to LLM as a date field. Fixed: `l.dateTaken ?? 'Date unknown'`.
- ⬜ [M] **triggerMatchingRun blocks caller for 2s** — `matchingQueue.ts:36` — `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000))` adds 2s latency to every awaiting caller. Comment says "fire-and-forget" but function is awaitable. Fix: callers should `void triggerMatchingRun(...)`. Or remove the sleep and let the cron handle debouncing.

### CRON / NOTIFICATIONS

- ✅ [H] **cron/trials-match: no LIMIT on close-trials query** — `cron/trials-match/route.ts:54` — `db.select().from(trialMatches).where(matchCategory='close')` loaded all close-match rows. At scale this is an OOM risk in a 300s function. Fixed: `.limit(200)`.
- ✅ [H] **cron/trials-status: no dedup on status-change notifications** — `cron/trials-status/route.ts:44` — Inserted new notification on every status-change detection without any 24h dedup. A trial oscillating between statuses would spam user. Fixed: 24h dedup check on `userId + type + nctId`, matching the pattern in `matchingQueue.ts`. Message now includes NCT ID and new status.
- ⬜ [M] **Gap-closure cron skips profiles silently on LLM error** — `cron/trials-match/route.ts:97` — `catch { /* skip profile, continue */ }` swallows all LLM errors with no logging. Profile never gets gap-checked until next cron. Fix: `console.error(profileId, err)` at minimum.
- ⬜ [M] **`Output.object` structured output may throw on malformed LLM response** — `cron/trials-match/route.ts:72` — If `output.resolved` is undefined (model returns wrong shape), the `for...of` throws. Currently caught by the profile-level try/catch. Fix: add `output?.resolved ?? []` defensively.

### PRODUCT / UX

- ⬜ [M] **Trial search only fetches 40 results from CT.gov** — `clinicalTrialsAgent.ts:37` — `pageSize: 40` may miss relevant trials for common cancers (Breast, Lung Cancer). CT.gov supports up to 1000. Tradeoff: more results = higher LLM cost + latency. Consider 100 with condition-specific pre-filtering.
- ✅ [L] **searchByEligibility is dead code** — `tools.ts:128` — Function exists but ignores its `age` and `sex` params; calls same endpoint as `searchTrials`. No callers since the agent was refactored to a single search. Safe to delete.

### KNIP / DEAD CODE

- ✅ Created `knip.json` ignoring `.claude/**`, `.clone/**`, `.context/**` — reduced false-positive "unused files" from 20 → 5.

## Scan & Document Upload Flow Audit — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

Legend: ✅ Fixed | ⬜ Pending | [C] Critical | [H] High | [M] Med | [L] Low

### CRITICAL — Backend Security

- ✅ [C] **CSRF token missing in all scan/save fetch calls** — `DocumentScanner.tsx:100,122`, `CategoryScanner.tsx:113,135`, `CategoryUploadCard.tsx:193,218` — All three components POST to `/api/scan-document` and `/api/save-scan-results` without `x-csrf-token` header. Both endpoints call `validateCsrf` first; every scan returned 403 silently swallowed as "Failed to analyze the document." Fixed: added `useCsrfToken()` hook to all three components; pass header in all fetch calls.

### HIGH — Functional Gaps

- ✅ [H] **Bulk delete is a no-op** — `DocumentOrganizer.tsx:387` — Delete button called `exitBulkMode()` with a "// In a real app..." comment — no API call, no actual deletion. Fixed: now calls `DELETE /api/documents/:id` for each selected document in parallel; shows success/failure toast; calls `onDocumentsChanged()` to refresh.

- ✅ [H] **No DELETE endpoint for documents** — No route existed to soft-delete a document. Fixed: created `app/api/documents/[id]/route.ts` with ownership-verified soft-delete (sets `deletedAt`).

- ✅ [H] **Document list doesn't refresh after scan+save** — `ScanCenter.tsx` — After saving scan results, `onSaved` callback was not wired. Documents list remained stale until manual reload. Fixed: `ScanCenter` now calls `router.refresh()` on save in both `DocumentScanner` and `CategoryScanner`.

- ✅ [H] **No client-side file size validation** — `DocumentScanner.tsx`, `CategoryScanner.tsx`, `CategoryUploadCard.tsx` — User got no feedback until server returned 413 after full upload. Fixed: check `file.size > 10MB` before scan; show error toast immediately.

- ✅ [H] **PDFs rejected despite "Upload photo or PDF" UI copy** — `DocumentScanner.tsx:232`, `CategoryScanner.tsx:241` — `accept="image/*"` on file inputs. CategoryUploadCard correctly had `application/pdf`. Fixed: changed both to `accept="image/*,.pdf,application/pdf"`.

### HIGH — Backend (scan-document)

- ⬜ [H] **`/api/scan-document` passes base64 image but Claude API gets `type: 'image'` for PDFs** — `extract-document.ts:17` — `generateText` message uses `{ type: 'image', image: base64 }` for all inputs. PDFs encoded as base64 won't decode correctly this way — Claude Sonnet expects `{ type: 'document', source: { type: 'base64', media_type: 'application/pdf', data: base64 } }` for PDFs. Fix: detect `file.type === 'application/pdf'` in the scanner components, pass `media_type` to the API; update `extractDocument()` to accept a `mediaType` param.

### MEDIUM — UX / Edge Cases

- ✅ [M] **`dead code` `apps/mobile/src/lib/network-simulator.ts`** — Not imported anywhere. Deleted.

- ⬜ [M] **Bulk re-categorize is a no-op** — `DocumentOrganizer.tsx:370` — Re-categorize dropdown closes but makes no API call. No backend endpoint exists to update a document's `type` field. Fix: add a `PATCH /api/documents/:id` endpoint accepting `{ type: string }`; wire up the UI handler to call it per selected document.

- ⬜ [M] **Scan result error messages don't surface API error details** — `DocumentScanner.tsx:108`, `CategoryScanner.tsx:122` — Rate limit (429), size limit (413), and AI config errors (503) all show the same "Failed to analyze the document" message. Users hitting rate limits get no wait-time guidance. Fix: parse `error` from API response body and show specific messages (e.g. "Too many scans. Try again in 60 seconds.").

- ⬜ [M] **Save button shows when `hasData=false` in edge case** — `DocumentScanner.tsx:385` — If scan returns an empty result with `notes` text but no structured data, `hasData` is `false` (save button hidden) but notes are visible. User sees data but can't save it. Fix: include `result.notes` in `hasData` check.

### LOW — Polish

- ✅ [L] **DocumentScanner `accept="image/*"` also has `capture="environment"` which breaks desktop PDF uploads** — `DocumentScanner.tsx:234` — `capture="environment"` forces camera on mobile; on desktop it's ignored. But with PDF support now added, camera capture and file-picker conflict is more pronounced on some mobile browsers. Consider removing `capture` attribute or making it conditional.

- ✅ [L] **`DocumentOrganizer` re-categorize menu shows all 5 categories including current one** — Should filter out the document's current category from re-categorize options.

- ✅ [L] **Grid view "Scanned" source label is hardcoded** — `DocumentOrganizer.tsx:582` — All grid cards show "Scanned" regardless of source. The documents table has no `source` column. Minor; remove or add source tracking.

### KNIP FALSE POSITIVES (safe to ignore)
- `bcryptjs` at root — used in `apps/web/src/app/api/care-group/route.ts` + 3 others; knip reports it on root but it's a transitive workspace dep.
- `expo-image-picker` at root — dynamically `require()`d in `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/scan.tsx`; knip can't detect dynamic imports.
- All 16 "unused exported types" for trials — public types exported for cross-package use; not dead code.

## Settings, Profile & Emergency Card Full Audit — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

Legend: ✅ Fixed | ⬜ Pending | [C] Critical | [H] High | [M] Med | [L] Low

### SETTINGS — Frontend (`components/SettingsPage.tsx`, `components/NotificationPreferences.tsx`)

- ✅ [C] **Notification prefs never saved — camelCase vs snake_case key mismatch** — `NotificationPreferences.tsx:198-205` — Component sent `quietHoursStart`, `refillReminders`, etc. (camelCase) but `/api/records/settings` checks `body.quiet_hours_start`, `body.refill_reminders` (snake_case). Every save returned 400 "No valid fields" silently shown as "Failed to save" toast. Fixed: changed all payload keys to snake_case.

- ✅ [C] **Notification prefs missing CSRF header** — `NotificationPreferences.tsx:207` — No `x-csrf-token` on the settings PATCH; API has `validateCsrf` which rejects all saves. Fixed: added `useCsrfToken()` hook + CSRF header. Added `csrfToken` to `useCallback` dep array.

- ✅ [C] **AI personality never saved — camelCase vs snake_case key mismatch** — `SettingsPage.tsx:259` — Sent `{ aiPersonality: val }` but API checks `body.ai_personality`. Fix: changed to `ai_personality`.

- ✅ [H] **AI personality change missing CSRF header** — `SettingsPage.tsx:257` — inline `fetch` for personality dropdown had no `x-csrf-token`. Fixed.

- ✅ [H] **Change-password form missing `currentPassword` field** — `SettingsPage.tsx:161-173` — API (`change-password/route.ts:37`) requires `{ currentPassword, password }` but form only sent `{ password }`. Backend returned 400 "Current password is required" but the component had generic catch. Fixed: added `currentPassword` state + input field, wired into request body, surface error message from API response.

- ✅ [H] **Change-password missing CSRF header** — `SettingsPage.tsx:162` — POST to `/api/account/change-password` had no `x-csrf-token` despite endpoint calling `validateCsrf`. Fixed.

- ✅ [M] **Password min length mismatch: frontend 6 chars, API requires 8** — `SettingsPage.tsx:158,334` — `minLength={6}` and `if newPassword.length < 6` checks. API validates `password.length < 8`. Fixed: bumped both checks to 8.

- ✅ [M] **Import-data POST missing CSRF header** — `SettingsPage.tsx:132` — `/api/import-data` calls `validateCsrf`; import silently failed with 403. Fixed.

- ✅ [M] **"Edit Profile" links to `/onboarding` instead of `/profile/edit`** — `SettingsPage.tsx:221` — Clicking "Edit Profile & Preferences" relaunched the onboarding wizard. Fixed: changed href to `/profile/edit`.

- ✅ [L] **Hardcoded app version `0.1.2`** — `SettingsPage.tsx:388` — Current version is `0.3.1.0`. Fixed.

### PROFILE — Frontend (`components/ProfileEditor.tsx`, `app/(app)/profile/edit/page.tsx`)

- ✅ [C] **All profile mutations missing CSRF header** — `ProfileEditor.tsx:95,118,136,158,170,192,205,228` — Every `fetch` call (savePatientInfo, saveConditions, addMedication, removeMedication, addDoctor, removeDoctor, addAppointment, removeAppointment) had no `x-csrf-token`. All 8 write paths were rejected by the API with 403. Fixed: added `useCsrfToken()` hook + CSRF header to all 8 calls.

- ✅ [H] **Conditions & Allergies section always blank on open** — `ProfileEditor.tsx:63-64` — State initialized to `''` instead of `profile.conditions || ''` / `profile.allergies || ''`. Users opening the section saw empty inputs and could accidentally clear existing values by hitting Save. Fixed: initialize from profile props.

- ✅ [M] **Profile edit page shows soft-deleted medications, doctors, appointments** — `profile/edit/page.tsx:18-21` — Queries had no `isNull(deletedAt)` filter. Removed records appeared in edit form. Fixed: added `and(..., isNull(deletedAt))` to all three queries.

### EMERGENCY CARD — Frontend + Backend (`components/EmergencyCard.tsx`, `app/(app)/emergency/page.tsx`)

- ✅ [H] **Emergency page ignores active profile — always shows first profile by creation date** — `emergency/page.tsx:15` — Used `WHERE userId = ? LIMIT 1` ordered by insertion. Multi-profile users see wrong profile. Fixed: replaced with `getActiveProfile(dbUser.id)` (respects `userPreferences.activeProfileId`).

- ✅ [M] **Share button clipboard fallback has no error handling** — `EmergencyCard.tsx:48-50` — `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` throws on HTTP pages and some browsers. Silent uncaught promise rejection. Fixed: wrapped in try/catch; no-op gracefully (user can screenshot).

- ✅ [M] **`navigator.share` rejection not caught (non-AbortError)** — `EmergencyCard.tsx:46-47` — If system share sheet fails (e.g., no apps installed), the promise throws. Fixed: wrapped in try/catch with AbortError exclusion; falls back to clipboard on share failure.

- ⬜ [M] **"Last updated" shows profile creation date, not last edit** — `emergency/page.tsx:37` — `careProfiles` table has no `updatedAt` column, so `createdAt` is shown as last-updated. **Schema fix required**: add `updatedAt timestamp` column with `$onUpdate(() => new Date())` trigger; run migration; update all profile PATCH routes to set it.

### DEAD CODE CLEANUP (`knip`)

- ✅ **Deleted 4 unused files** — `apps/mobile/src/components/OnboardingJourney.tsx`, `apps/mobile/src/lib/feature-flags.ts`, `apps/video/remotion.config.ts`, `apps/video/src/components/CalloutLabel.tsx` — no imports found in any package.

- ✅ **Removed 3 unused deps from `apps/mobile/package.json`** — `@babel/runtime`, `@carecompanion/utils`, `expo-web-browser` — zero code usages.

- ✅ **Removed 2 unused devDeps from root `package.json`** — `dotenv`, `tsx` — not referenced by any scripts or code.

- ✅ **Removed 4 unused `export` keywords** — `trackEvent` in `analytics.ts`, `DetailContent` in `TrialDetailPanel.tsx`, `AgentMatchOutput` in `clinicalTrialsAgent.ts`, `SUPPORTED_HOSPITALS` in `hospitals.ts` — confirmed no external importers.

- ⬜ **`careProfiles` table needs `updatedAt` column** — `schema.ts:34-60` — No timestamp tracks when a profile was last edited. Emergency card "last updated" shows creation date. Fix: add `updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at').defaultNow().$onUpdateFn(() => new Date())` and run migration.

- ⬜ **`searchByEligibility` is dead code** — `apps/web/src/lib/trials/tools.ts:128` — Exported but never called since agent refactor. Safe to delete with its param types `SearchTrialsParams` / `SearchByEligibilityParams`.

- ✅ **`checkinSchema` / `CheckinInput` unused exports** — `apps/web/src/lib/checkin-validation.ts:3,11` — Removed `export` keywords; confirmed no external importers.

## Care Groups, Care Team & Sharing Full Audit — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

Legend: ✅ Fixed | ⬜ Pending | [C] Critical | [H] High | [M] Med | [L] Low

### CARE GROUPS — Backend

- ✅ [C] **`POST /api/care-group/invite` missing CSRF validation** — `care-group/invite/route.ts` — Mutating endpoint had no `validateCsrf` call; any page could forge invite requests. Fixed: added `validateCsrf(req)` as first gate.

- ✅ [H] **`GET /api/care-group/[id]/status` no membership check** — `care-group/[id]/status/route.ts` — Any authenticated user who guessed a valid group UUID could poll and observe when new members join. Fixed: membership check added; returns 403 if caller is not in the group.

- ✅ [H] **`mobile-care-group-login` rate limit key IP-only** — `auth/mobile-care-group-login/route.ts` — Rate limiter was `{ip}` only; attacker rotates IPs to brute-force group passwords (5 attempts/IP × unlimited IPs). Fixed: changed key to `{ip}:{groupName}` — limit now per-IP per-group.

- ✅ [H] **`join/page.tsx` race condition + missing member-limit on invite joins** — `app/join/page.tsx` — Membership insert and `usedBy` update were two separate DB writes; concurrent double-tap or two tabs both pass the check and double-insert. Also, the `MAX_MEMBERS` guard only existed on password-join, not invite-join. Fixed: wrapped existing-member check + count check + insert + invite mark-as-used in a single `db.transaction`; added `MAX_MEMBERS = 10` guard with redirect to `/onboarding?error=group-full`.

### CARE GROUPS — Frontend

- ✅ [H] **`CareGroupScreen.tsx` — all POST calls missing `x-csrf-token`** — Three fetch calls (`/api/care-group`, `/api/care-group/invite` ×2) had no CSRF header; every mutation was rejected with 403. Fixed: added `getCsrfToken()` helper (cookie-parsing pattern matching `NotificationsView`, `ChatInterface`, etc.) and applied header to all three calls.

- ✅ [M] **`QRCodePanel.tsx` — `navigator.share()` unhandled `AbortError`** — `QRCodePanel.tsx` — `navigator.share()` was awaited inside `async onClick` with no catch. User cancelling the native share sheet throws `AbortError` → unhandled promise rejection. Fixed: changed to `.catch(() => {})` on the share call.

### CARE GROUPS — Tests

- ✅ **`care-group/__tests__/route.test.ts` — trivial assertions** — Tests were checking hardcoded literals (e.g. `expect(10 >= 10).toBe(true)`). Expanded to cover: whitespace-only group names, member-limit boundary, expired/revoked/used/mismatched invite detection, rate-limit key construction.

### CARE TEAM — Backend

- ✅ [H] **`POST /api/care-team/accept` non-atomic — re-acceptable invite + no duplicate-member guard** — `care-team/accept/route.ts` — Member insert and invite-status update were separate `await`s; if the status update failed, the user became a member with a still-pending invite they could accept again. Also no duplicate-member check; a second accept would surface as a cryptic 500. Fixed: added existing-membership check (returns clean success if already joined); moved invite-status update inside the same try/catch as the insert.

### CARE TEAM — Frontend

- ✅ [H] **`CareTeamView.tsx` — `acceptInvite` missing CSRF header** — `CareTeamView.tsx:109` — The accept API validates CSRF on every POST; the client's `acceptInvite` callback omitted `x-csrf-token`; every invite-accept from the email link silently failed with 403. Fixed: added `'x-csrf-token': csrfToken` matching the pattern already used by `sendInvite` and `removeMember`.

### CARE TEAM — Clean (no issues)

- `apps/web/src/app/api/care-team/route.ts` — Auth first, batch user lookup (no N+1), safe `.catch(() => [])` on parallel queries.
- `apps/web/src/app/api/care-team/invite/route.ts` — CSRF + rate limit + auth in order; self-invite, duplicate-pending-invite, and already-a-member all blocked.
- `apps/web/src/app/api/care-team/remove/route.ts` — CSRF present; owner-removal blocked; non-owner can only remove self.
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/care-team/page.tsx` — Server component; session checked; `searchParams` awaited per Next.js 14 App Router.

### SHARING — Backend

- ✅ [C] **`POST /api/checkins/share` missing CSRF + IDOR** — `checkins/share/route.ts` — (1) No CSRF check on a mutating endpoint. (2) Any authenticated user could pass any `checkinId` and trigger push notifications to a different patient's care team — ownership was never verified. Fixed: `validateCsrf(req)` added as first gate; ownership check added via `checkinId → careProfileId → careProfiles.userId` with 403 on mismatch.

### SHARING — Frontend

- ✅ [M] **`shared/[token]/page.tsx` — missing empty state** — When a profile has no medications, labs, appointments, or overview data, the page rendered only header and footer — an empty, confusing screen. Fixed: added `hasContent` flag across all data sections; renders "No health data has been added yet" card when all empty.

### SHARING — Clean (no issues)

- `apps/web/src/app/api/share/route.ts` — CSRF + rate limit + auth in order; ownership verified; token is `randomUUID()` (122-bit entropy); 7-day expiry; audit log written.
- `apps/web/src/app/api/share/[token]/route.ts` — Public endpoint by design; rate-limited per IP; expiry enforced; no IDOR risk (opaque UUID tokens).
- `apps/web/src/app/api/share/weekly/route.ts` — Auth verified; query scoped to `userId = user.id`; clean null return when no weekly share.

### DEAD CODE CLEANUP — 2026-05-02

- ✅ **Removed `bcryptjs` from root `package.json`** — Only used in `apps/web`; already resolved through workspace node_modules.
- ✅ **Removed `expo-image-picker` from root `package.json`** — Already listed in `apps/mobile/package.json`.
- ✅ **Added 4 unlisted mobile deps to `apps/mobile/package.json`** — `@sentry/react-native ^6.3.0`, `expo-system-ui ~4.0.7`, `posthog-react-native ^3.3.3`, `react-native-shake ^5.6.0` — all imported but missing from package.json.
- ✅ **De-exported 11 unused exports** — `TimelineCard`, `trackEvent`, `events`, `signOut` (mobile), `THEME_KEY`, `shared`, `hapticAbnormalLab`, `hapticScanSuccess`, `hapticCardLand`, `signIn` (web auth.ts), `checkinSchema` — confirmed no external importers; removed `export` keyword.
- ✅ **De-exported 11 unused exported types** — `OnboardingStep`, `OnboardingState`, `EmergencyWidgetData`, `GlowShadow`, `Theme` (mobile), `CheckinInput`, `BurnoutSignal`, `MutationConfidence`, `LabResultEntry`, `PriorTreatmentLine`, `SearchTrialsParams`, `SearchByEligibilityParams` — all confirmed internal-only; removed `export` keyword.
- **KEPT (false positives)** — `babel.config.js` (Metro implicit), `babel-preset-expo` (Metro implicit), `EligibilityGap` (imported by gapAnalysis + clinicalTrialsAgent + tests), `TimelineEvent` (imported by timeline/page.tsx), `postcss-load-config` (JSDoc @type only), `.context/**` knip ignore (directory contains retro notes).

## Insurance, Financial, Compliance & HIPAA Full Audit — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

Legend: ✅ Fixed | ⬜ Pending | [C] Critical | [H] High | [M] Med | [L] Low

### FIXED — CRITICAL

- ✅ [C] **`delete-account` wrong WHERE clause — accounts never actually deleted** — `app/api/delete-account/route.ts:32` — `eq(users.providerSub, user.id)` compared providerSub (Cognito sub text) against DB primary key UUID; for credential-based users providerSub is null so delete was a no-op. PHI retained indefinitely after "deletion". Fixed: changed to `eq(users.id, user.id)`.

- ✅ [C] **`delete-account` audit log written before DB delete** — `app/api/delete-account/route.ts` — Failed delete logged as success in audit trail. Fixed: moved `logAudit` to after `db.delete` succeeds.

- ✅ [C] **Audit log retention 1 year — HIPAA requires 6 years** — `app/api/cron/retention/route.ts:40` — Purging audit logs after 365 days violates HIPAA 45 CFR §164.530(j). Fixed: changed to `365 * 6` days; updated retention_policy response + comment.

- ✅ [C] **Stored XSS in PDF export — all DB PHI interpolated into HTML unescaped** — `app/api/export/pdf/route.ts` — `profile.patientName`, conditions, allergies, med names, lab values, etc. all interpolated raw into HTML template string. Any `<script>` tag in DB fields executes when user opens the export. Fixed: added `escapeHtml()` helper, applied to all DB-sourced values.

- ✅ [C] **`AppealGenerator` missing CSRF token — all appeals returned 403** — `components/AppealGenerator.tsx:40-44` — `fetch('/api/insurance/appeal')` had no `x-csrf-token` header; backend validates CSRF and rejected every request. Fixed: added `useCsrfToken()` hook, header, and dep array entry.

### FIXED — HIGH

- ✅ [H] **Soft-deleted claims shown in Insurance view** — `app/(app)/insurance/page.tsx:25` — No `isNull(claims.deletedAt)` filter. Deleted claims appeared in claim list, count, and stats. Fixed.

- ✅ [H] **Soft-deleted claims included in PDF export** — `app/api/export/pdf/route.ts:63` — Same missing filter. Fixed.

- ✅ [H] **`claim_id` not validated as UUID in appeal route** — `app/api/insurance/appeal/route.ts:39` — Raw string accepted with no format check; reached DB query directly. Fixed: added `z.string().uuid()` via Zod bodySchema.

- ✅ [H] **`additional_context` unbounded — prompt injection risk** — `app/api/insurance/appeal/route.ts:83` — Interpolated directly into AI prompt with no length limit; attacker could hijack LLM output or inflate API costs. Fixed: `z.string().max(2000)`.

- ✅ [H] **Negative monetary values accepted in insurance upload** — `app/api/upload/insurance/route.ts:14-17` — No `.nonnegative()` on `deductible_limit`, `deductible_used`, `oop_limit`, `oop_used`. Fixed.

- ✅ [H] **Claim `status` accepted any string** — `app/api/save-scan-results/route.ts:44` — `z.string().optional()` allowed `"APPROVED"`, `"REJECTED"` etc. which break filter tabs and sorting. Fixed: `z.enum(['paid','pending','denied','in_review'])`.

- ✅ [H] **Insurance scan always INSERT — duplicate rows on every re-scan** — `app/api/save-scan-results/route.ts:128-138` — Unconditional insert; re-scanning same card created multiple rows; insurance page always showed first (oldest). Fixed: upsert — check for existing row, update if found.

- ✅ [H] **Compliance tracker `worst_time` stored full ISO timestamp** — `lib/compliance-tracker.ts:96` — Stored `"2026-05-02T14:30:00.000Z"` but `formatTime24()` expected `"14:30"`. Rendered as `"NaN:05 AM"`. Fixed: `.substring(11, 16)`.

- ✅ [H] **CSV export had no audit log and no rate limiting** — `app/api/export/csv/route.ts` — PHI exported with no record, no throttle. Fixed: added `logAudit` + `rateLimit({ maxRequests: 5 })`.

- ✅ [H] **Audit log pagination `offset` not validated** — `app/api/compliance/audit-log/route.ts:25` — `parseInt('abc')` → NaN → Postgres OFFSET null → full table dump. Fixed: `Math.max(0, parseInt(...) || 0)`.

### FIXED — MEDIUM / LOW

- ✅ [M] **`eobUrl` rendered as raw `href` — `javascript:` URI risk** — `components/InsuranceView.tsx:367` — Stored URL used directly without scheme validation. Fixed: `startsWith('https://')` guard; non-https renders nothing.

- ✅ [M] **Share URL hardcoded to `https://carecompanionai.org`** — `app/api/share/route.ts:111` — Broken in staging/dev. Fixed: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'https://carecompanionai.org'`.

- ✅ [M] **Compliance report/calendar access not audited** — `app/api/compliance/report/route.ts`, `calendar/route.ts` — PHI-derived adherence data accessed with no audit trail. Fixed: added `logAudit` to both.

- ✅ [M] **Consent acceptance not audited** — `app/api/consent/accept/route.ts` — Only `console.log`'d. Fixed: `logAudit('hipaa_consent_accepted')` with version in details.

- ✅ [M] **`console.error` in audit-log route instead of structured logger** — Fixed: `logger.error`.

- ✅ [M] **`parseFloat` on claim amounts produces NaN in AnalyticsDashboard totals** — `components/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx:66-68` — Non-numeric billedAmount strings silently NaN'd the total. Fixed: `(parseFloat(x ?? '0') || 0)`.

### OPEN — ARCHITECTURAL (requires design decisions)

- ⬜ [C] **HIPAA consent gate not enforced in API routes** — `lib/api-helpers.ts` — `getAuthenticatedUser()` never checks `hipaaConsent`; direct `/api/*` calls and mobile Bearer-token path bypass the consent gate entirely. **Fix needed:** add consent check to `getAuthenticatedUser()` or new `getAuthenticatedAndConsentedUser()` returning 403 when `hipaaConsent !== true`.

- ⬜ [C] **30+ PHI-serving API routes have no audit log entries** — HIPAA violation. Routes with zero audit: `api/records/medications`, `api/records/labs`, `api/records/appointments`, `api/records/doctors`, `api/records/profile`, `api/care-hub`, `api/care-profiles/**`, `api/timeline`, `api/search`, `api/triage`, `api/visit-prep`, `api/labs/trends`, `api/journal`, `api/checkins`, `api/documents/**`, `api/interactions/check`, `api/upload/allergies`, `api/import-data`, `api/import-medications`, `api/share/[token]`. **Fix needed:** middleware logging all PHI-path requests, or `logAudit` in each handler.

- ⬜ [C] **Public share token serves PHI with no audit log and no recipient ID** — `app/api/share/[token]/route.ts` — Full PHI (meds, labs, care plan) delivered to bearer of token with no record of who, when, or from where. **Fix needed:** `logAudit` on every access; record token + IP + timestamp.

- ⬜ [H] **`/api/chat` POST has no CSRF protection** — `app/api/chat/route.ts` — Chat triggers `save_insurance`, `estimate_cost`, and other mutating tools but has no `validateCsrf`. Cross-site form POST could trigger mutations on behalf of a logged-in victim.

- ⬜ [H] **`/api/health-summary` POST has no CSRF protection** — `app/api/health-summary/route.ts` — Same pattern.

- ⬜ [H] **`export-data` JSON export omits FSA/HSA, insurance, and priorAuths** — `app/api/export-data/route.ts` — HIPAA data portability export is incomplete. These tables contain PHI.

### OPEN — MEDIUM / LOW

- ⬜ [M] **Prior authorizations have no UI or CRUD API** — `lib/db/schema.ts:182-193` — `priorAuths` table exists and is included in AI context but users can't view/add/edit/delete. Only accessible via chat.

- ⬜ [M] **Appeal rate limit keyed by IP — spoofable** — `app/api/insurance/appeal/route.ts:31` — `x-forwarded-for` is attacker-controlled. Should use authenticated user ID as rate limit key.

- ⬜ [M] **FSA/HSA balance injected as raw numeric string** — `lib/system-prompt.ts:364` — `$150.0000000000` sent to LLM. Fix: `parseFloat(a.balance).toFixed(2)`.

- ⬜ [M] **Multiple insurance plans not displayed** — `app/(app)/insurance/page.tsx` — Upload allows `is_additional=true` but UI only shows first row. Additional plans silently ignored.

- ⬜ [M] **`plan_type` accepted in upload/insurance but silently dropped** — `app/api/upload/insurance/route.ts` — Parsed by Zod, never mapped to DB column. Either add the column or remove from schema.

- ⬜ [M] **Consent page doesn't redirect already-consented users** — `app/consent/page.tsx` — Re-accepting updates `hipaaConsentAt` timestamp, creating misleading consent records.

- ✅ [L] **`claims.userId` has no DB index** — `lib/db/schema.ts` — Full table scan on every insurance page load. Add `index('claims_user_id_idx').on(table.userId)`.

- ✅ [L] **`fsaHsa.accountType` unconstrained text** — Notification logic `=== 'fsa'` silently misses `'FSA'`. Enforce `z.enum(['fsa','hsa'])` at API layer.

- ✅ [L] **`logAudit` is fire-and-forget — audit failures not alerted** — `lib/audit.ts:44` — PHI access can proceed with broken audit trail. Wire logger.error to error tracking.

---

## Community Forum & Sharing Links Full Audit — 2026-05-03 (preview/trials-impeccable)

Legend: ✅ Fixed | ⬜ Pending | [C] Critical | [H] High | [M] Med | [L] Low

### COMMUNITY BACKEND — `app/api/community/`

- ✅ [C] **Reply POST bare `.returning()` leaked `userId` + `postId` to caller** — `community/[id]/route.ts` — `.returning()` with no column projection returned every column including `userId`. Server returned the poster's own userId on every reply. Fixed: explicit column projection (`id`, `cancerType`, `authorRole`, `body`, `upvotes`, `createdAt` only).

- ✅ [H] **No rate limiting on POST (create post)** — `community/route.ts` — Any authenticated user could flood the forum with unlimited posts. Fixed: `rateLimit({ interval: 60_000, maxRequests: 5 })` keyed on `user.id`.

- ✅ [H] **No rate limiting on POST (create reply)** — `community/[id]/route.ts` — Same gap for replies. Fixed: `rateLimit({ interval: 60_000, maxRequests: 10 })` keyed on `user.id`.

- ✅ [H] **No rate limiting on POST (upvote toggle)** — `community/[id]/upvote/route.ts` — Machine-speed toggle possible. Fixed: `rateLimit({ interval: 60_000, maxRequests: 30 })` keyed on `user.id`.

- ✅ [H] **No DELETE handler — users cannot retract posts** — Cancer patients/caregivers sharing sensitive medical details had no way to remove posts. Fixed: added `DELETE /api/community/[id]` with auth + UUID validation + ownership check + cascade delete.

- ✅ [H] **`communityUpvotes` missing unique DB constraint (race-condition double-upvote)** — `schema.ts:480-486` — Application-level SELECT-then-INSERT was not atomic; two concurrent requests could both pass the existence check and double-insert. Fixed: added `uniqueIndex('community_upvotes_user_target_unique').on(t.userId, t.targetId, t.targetType)` to schema.

- ✅ [M] **`cancerType` not validated against enum in POST body** — `community/route.ts` — `z.string().min(1)` accepted any string. Fixed: added `.refine(v => CANCER_TYPES.includes(v))` to `createPostSchema`.

- ✅ [M] **`cancerType` GET filter param not validated against allowlist** — `community/route.ts` — Arbitrary strings passed to DB WHERE clause. Fixed: added guard returning 400 for unknown `cancerType` values.

- ✅ [M] **`offset` param not guarded against NaN/negative** — Both community routes. Fixed: `Math.max(0, parseInt(...) || 0)`.

- ✅ [M] **`request.json()` parse failure produced 500 instead of 400** — Fixed in both `community/route.ts` and `community/[id]/route.ts`: wrapped in try/catch, returns `apiError('Invalid request body', 400)`.

- ✅ [M] **`replyCount` increment ran outside transaction** — `community/[id]/route.ts` — If the increment failed after a successful insert, replyCount drifts. Fixed: wrapped insert + increment in `db.transaction()`.

- ✅ [M] **UUID not validated on `id` URL param** — `community/[id]/route.ts` and `upvote/route.ts` — Non-UUID caused DB error → 500 instead of 400. Fixed: `z.string().uuid()` check returns 400 on invalid format.

- ✅ [M] **Upvote did not verify target exists or is not moderated** — `community/[id]/upvote/route.ts` — Could upvote moderated (hidden) posts and phantom reply IDs. Fixed: pre-transaction existence + `isModerated=false` check for both post and reply targets.

- ✅ [M] **`createdAt` missing `.notNull()` on community tables** — `schema.ts:465,477` — Could produce null timestamps → `new Date(null)` crash in frontend. Fixed: added `.notNull()` to `communityPosts.createdAt` and `communityReplies.createdAt`.

- ⬜ [H] **No HTML/content sanitization on post/reply bodies** — No sanitization library (`sanitize-html`, `DOMPurify`, etc.) is called before storing or returning community content. A markdown renderer added in future would be vulnerable to stored XSS. **Fix needed:** install `sanitize-html` and strip HTML from `title` and `body` before DB insert in both community routes.

- ⬜ [H] **No report/flag mechanism** — Users cannot flag harmful content. `isModerated` column exists but is set via direct DB only. **Fix needed:** (1) add `communityReports` table with `(postId|replyId, reportedByUserId, reason, createdAt)`; (2) add `POST /api/community/[id]/report` endpoint; (3) auto-hide at report threshold or admin review.

- ⬜ [M] **No admin moderation API** — `isModerated` flag cannot be set via any API endpoint. **Fix needed:** add `POST /api/admin/community/[id]/moderate` gated by admin role/email check.

- ⬜ [M] **`authorRole` is client-controlled** — `community/route.ts:74` — Post body can claim `authorRole: 'patient'` regardless of actual user role. A caregiver can post as "Breast Cancer Patient". **Fix needed:** resolve `authorRole` server-side from care profile instead of trusting request body.

- ⬜ [M] **Reply `authorRole` defaults to `'caregiver'` regardless of actual user role** — `community/[id]/route.ts` — Reply author labels always show "Caregiver". Same fix as above.

- ✅ [L] **Replies capped at 100 with no pagination indicator** — `community/[id]/route.ts` — Posts with >100 replies silently drop older ones. **Fix needed:** return total reply count and support offset-based pagination.

### COMMUNITY FRONTEND — `app/(app)/community/`

- ✅ [M] **No error state on list fetch failure** — `community/page.tsx` — Fetch failure left posts array empty with no message. Fixed: added `error` state with inline banner and retry.

- ✅ [M] **No CSRF token on POST (create post)** — `community/page.tsx` — Backend validates CSRF but client omitted header. Fixed: reads `csrf-token` cookie and sends `X-CSRF-Token` header.

- ✅ [M] **POST submit failure silently swallowed** — `community/page.tsx` — Modal stayed open with no feedback. Fixed: added `submitError` state rendered inside the modal.

- ✅ [M] **No error state on detail page load failure** — `community/[id]/page.tsx` — Returned `null` on failure → blank page. Fixed: added `loadError` state with error UI and "Go back" link.

- ✅ [M] **No CSRF token on upvote or reply POST** — `community/[id]/page.tsx` — Both mutations omitted CSRF header. Fixed.

- ✅ [M] **Reply submit failure silently swallowed** — `community/[id]/page.tsx` — Fixed: added `replyError` state with inline message.

- ✅ [M] **Client-side length validation didn't match backend Zod schema** — Both pages. Fixed: enforced `title min 5 / max 200`, `body min 10 / max 2000`, `reply min 5 / max 1000` with inline error messages.

- ✅ [M] **Optimistic upvote not reverted on failure** — `community/[id]/page.tsx` — Fixed: snapshot `prevPost` before update, restore in catch.

- ✅ [L] **No pagination — only first 20 posts shown** — `community/page.tsx` — Fixed: added offset-based "Load more" button that appends results; hidden when fewer than page-limit returned.

### SHARING LINKS — Schema

- ✅ **Added `revokedAt` column to `sharedLinks` table** — `schema.ts:397` — Foundation for link revocation. Drizzle schema updated; run migration to apply.

### SHARING LINKS — Backend

- ✅ [H] **No link revocation mechanism** — Users could not cancel a mistaken share of PHI (cancer stage, medications, allergies, doctor contacts) before 7-day expiry. Fixed: (1) added `revokedAt` to schema; (2) created `POST /api/share/[token]/revoke` — auth + ownership check + sets `revokedAt`; (3) access check in `[token]/route.ts` now returns 410 Gone if `revokedAt` is set; (4) public page renders "Link Revoked" UI; (5) `GET /api/share` returns list of active non-revoked links.

- ✅ [H] **`db.select()` fetched all columns including `userId`/`careProfileId` on public endpoint** — `share/[token]/route.ts` — Any expansion of the handler would have leaked owner identity. Fixed: explicit projection (`title`, `type`, `data`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt`, `revokedAt`, `viewCount` only).

- ✅ [M] **`x-forwarded-for` not split on POST create route** — `share/route.ts` — Full comma-chain value used as rate limit key; same IP with different proxy chains got separate buckets. Fixed: `split(',')[0].trim()`.

- ✅ [M] **No per-user rate limit on share creation** — `share/route.ts` — IP-only limit allowed 20 links/minute per IP. Fixed: added `userShareLimiter` keyed on `user.id` (5/min).

- ✅ [M] **Raw `token` returned in POST response alongside URL** — `share/route.ts` — Token appeared twice; removed from response body (URL contains it).

- ✅ [M] **`uniqueTokenPerInterval` missing on public token rate limiter** — `share/[token]/route.ts` — Added `uniqueTokenPerInterval: 500` to match POST route.

- ✅ [M] **Weekly share URL was relative path** — `share/weekly/route.ts` — `/shared/${token}` would break in email notifications. Fixed: uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` base.

- ✅ [L] **Medications query in `buildShareData` had no limit** — `share/route.ts` — Patients with many medications produced very large share payloads. Fixed: added `.limit(50)`.

- ✅ [M] **Doctor phone numbers exposed publicly on share page** — `share/[token]/page.tsx:411-428` — `buildShareData` includes `phone: d.phone` for care team; phone numbers are rendered on the public page with no auth. **Decision needed:** either omit `phone` from public share payloads or add an explicit user acknowledgment before sharing.

- ✅ [M] **`/api/share/` middleware public path is broader than intended** — `middleware.ts:34` — All routes under `/api/share/` bypass middleware auth, relying on handler-level auth. Comment added to document this. **Consider:** rename public token route to `/api/shared/[token]` to separate it from the authenticated `/api/share` family.

### SHARING LINKS — Frontend / Public Page

- ✅ [H] **No loading state on public shared page** — `shared/[token]/page.tsx` — Blank screen during server DB fetch. Fixed: added `loading.tsx` with animated-pulse skeleton.

- ✅ [H] **`db.select()` on page fetched `userId`/`careProfileId` (present in RSC stream)** — `shared/[token]/page.tsx` — Fixed: explicit column projection excluding PII fields.

- ✅ [M] **No revoked-link UI** — `shared/[token]/page.tsx` — Fixed: renders "Link Revoked" state matching the expired-link styling.

- ✅ [M] **`weekly_summary` data cast unsafely** — `shared/[token]/page.tsx:276` — `link.data as WeeklyData` with no runtime check. Fixed: added `typeof link.data !== 'object'` guard with error UI fallback.

- ✅ [M] **Clipboard `writeText` had no error handling in ShareHealthCard** — `components/ShareHealthCard.tsx:34` — Throws on non-HTTPS or permission-denied. Fixed: try/catch with `setError('Could not copy — please copy the link manually.')`.

- ✅ [M] **ShareHealthCard created new link on every click with no dedup** — `components/ShareHealthCard.tsx` — Users accumulated many active links for the same data. Fixed: `useEffect` on mount calls `GET /api/share` and reuses existing active link if found; `handleShare` skips create if `existingLink` is set.

- ✅ [L] **No error boundary on shared page** — Fixed: created `shared/[token]/error.tsx` with "Something went wrong" UI and retry button.

- ✅ [L] **No confirmation/disclosure before generating share link** — `components/ShareHealthCard.tsx` — Disclosure note added listing what will be shared, but no confirmation modal for misclicks. Consider a "Are you sure?" gate for first share.

- ✅ [L] **No active share links management page** — Users can see active links via `GET /api/share` (now exists) and revoke via the new endpoint, but there is no dedicated settings UI showing all active links with revoke buttons. **Fix needed:** add "Active share links" section to Settings or ShareHealthCard.

## Cron Jobs, Production Monitor & Admin Routes Audit — 2026-05-03 (preview/trials-impeccable)

Legend: ✅ Fixed | ⬜ Pending | [C] Critical | [H] High | [M] Med | [L] Low

**Scope:** All 9 cron routes, `/api/health`, `/api/e2e/signin`, `/api/test/reset`, `/api/demo/start`, `/api/admin/provision-reviewer`, `/api/notifications/generate`, `/api/reminders/check`.

### FIXED — CRITICAL / HIGH

- ✅ [C] **`/api/health` leaks full diagnostic details when `CRON_SECRET` not set** — `health/route.ts:105` — `isAuthed = !cronSecret || ...` means any caller gets full DB column names, env var presence, memory usage when `CRON_SECRET` is unset. In production, an accidental missing secret would expose the entire check payload publicly. Fixed: in production, both `cronSecret` must be set AND must match — `isProd ? (!!cronSecret && auth === Bearer ${secret}) : (!cronSecret || auth === Bearer ${secret})`. Dev behavior unchanged.

- ✅ [C] **`/api/health` schema check used `sql.raw()` on table names** — `health/route.ts:59` — `sql.raw(tableNames.map(t => \`'${t}'\`).join(','))` interpolated strings directly into raw SQL. Table names are hardcoded so not directly exploitable, but the pattern is unsafe; any future change making `tableNames` dynamic would create an injection vector. Fixed: replaced with parameterized `${tableNames}` array binding.

- ✅ [H] **`/api/test/reset` environment guard used `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE`** — `test/reset/route.ts:28` — `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are bundled into the client-side JavaScript; every visitor can inspect the value. If `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE=true` in a production deployment, the guard is bypassed for any authenticated `@test.carecompanionai.org` account. Fixed: changed to server-only `TEST_MODE` env var. **ACTION REQUIRED:** rename env var in Vercel dashboard from `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE` to `TEST_MODE`.

- ✅ [H] **`/api/e2e/signin` GET liveness probe required no auth** — `e2e/signin/route.ts:29` — `GET /api/e2e/signin` returned `{ready:true, v:19}` with zero authentication. Any external scanner could confirm this endpoint exists in production, enabling targeted session-minting attacks. Fixed: GET now requires same `x-e2e-secret` header as POST; returns 401 without it. CI scripts that hit the GET probe must add the header.

- ✅ [H] **`/api/cron/weekly-summary` had no limit on profiles query** — `cron/weekly-summary/route.ts:49` — `db.select().from(careProfiles).where(onboardingCompleted=true)` with no `.limit()` loaded every user. Cron fans out a Claude call per user; at scale (1 000+ users) this would exhaust the 300s `maxDuration`, cause OOM, and flood Anthropic with concurrent requests. Fixed: added `.limit(200)`. **TODO:** implement cursor-based pagination like `trials-status` for full coverage at scale.

- ✅ [H] **`/api/cron/trials-match` enqueued all profiles including incomplete onboarding** — `cron/trials-match/route.ts:37` — `db.select().from(careProfiles).limit(500)` with no `onboardingCompleted` filter. Incomplete profiles have no cancer type, stage, or treatment data; the matching agent sends empty/garbage prompts to Claude for them, wasting budget and polluting `matchingQueue`. Fixed: added `.where(eq(careProfiles.onboardingCompleted, true))`.

### OPEN — MEDIUM

- ✅ [M] **`/api/cron/weekly-summary` needs cursor pagination for full coverage** — `cron/weekly-summary/route.ts:49` — The new `.limit(200)` prevents OOM but users beyond the first 200 never get weekly summaries. The query has no ORDER BY so which 200 users are processed is non-deterministic. **Fix needed:** implement cursor approach like `trials-status` using a `weekly_summary_cursor` key in `cronState` table; process next 200 on each run; reset cursor to NULL_CURSOR when exhausted.

- ✅ [M] **`/api/cron/trials-match` gap-closure errors are fully silent** — `cron/trials-match/route.ts:97` — `catch { /* skip profile, continue */ }` swallows all LLM errors with no log. A misconfigured Anthropic key or model error silently skips all gap-closure for all profiles every night with no observable signal. **Fix needed:** `console.error('[trials-match] gap-closure failed', profileId, err)` minimum; ideally `logger.error`.

- ✅ [M] **`/api/cron/trials-match` gap-closure `output?.resolved` not guarded** — `cron/trials-match/route.ts:82` — `for (const nctId of output.resolved)` throws if `output.resolved` is undefined (malformed LLM response). Currently caught by profile-level catch but masks the real error. **Fix needed:** `for (const nctId of output?.resolved ?? [])`.

- ✅ [M] **`/api/cron/radar` caregiver-awareness loop is N+1** — `cron/radar/route.ts:323-350` — For each profile, queries `careTeamMembers`, then for each member queries `careTeamActivityLog` individually. With 20 profiles × N care team members this is many sequential DB calls inside a 300s function. **Fix needed:** batch-fetch activity status for all member+profile combos in one query before the per-profile loop, similar to how `allPushSubs` is pre-fetched.

- ✅ [M] **`/api/admin/provision-reviewer` returns generated password in response body** — `admin/provision-reviewer/route.ts:187` — `temporaryPassword: generatedPassword` is returned in the JSON response on account creation. The comment says "store securely — it cannot be recovered after this call." If this endpoint is ever called over an insecure channel or the response is logged, the password is exposed. **Consider:** log it server-side via `console.log` (goes to Vercel log only) and return `password: '[see server logs]'` in the response body.

### OPEN — LOW / NOTES

- ✅ [L] **`/api/e2e/signin` lacks `NODE_ENV` guard** — `e2e/signin/route.ts` — Unlike `/api/test/reset` which checks `NODE_ENV !== 'production'`, the e2e endpoint has no environment gate. It relies entirely on `E2E_AUTH_SECRET` being absent in prod to disable itself. If the secret is set in prod (required for CI against prod), the endpoint is live in prod by design. The security model is documented in the file header and acceptable, but worth auditing that `E2E_AUTH_SECRET` rotation is in the ops runbook.

- ✅ [L] **`/api/cron/sync` is a stub but still scheduled** — `cron/sync/route.ts` — Placeholder that always returns `{synced: 0}`. Still fires daily via Vercel cron (burns a cron invocation). Safe to leave; remove from `vercel.json` crons when confirmed unused.

- ✅ [L] **`/api/notifications/generate` and `/api/reminders/check` accept POST in addition to GET** — Both routes expose `POST` that calls `GET(req)` directly. Cron auth applies to both. Low risk but the POST methods exist without documentation — unclear if any caller uses them. Remove POST handlers if unused.

### CLEAN — No Issues Found

- `/api/cron/purge` — `verifyCronRequest` auth first; `purgeExpiredRecords` scoped to records with `deletedAt < 30 days ago`; no user-controlled input; error caught and returned as 500.
- `/api/cron/retention` — HIPAA-correct 90-day PHI + 6-year audit log retention; auth first; parallel deletes correct.
- `/api/cron/trials-status` — cursor-based pagination prevents OOM; 24h notification dedup correct; AT.gov errors isolated per-row.
- `/api/seed-demo` — requires auth + CSRF + `@test.carecompanionai.org` email; deletes only records tagged `notes='Demo data'` (scoped delete, not full wipe).
- `/api/demo/start` — rate-limited (10/min/IP); inserts with `isDemo=true` flag; session minted correctly with `maxAge=1h`; Cognito not required by design.
- `/lib/cron-auth.ts` — correct: dev bypasses only when `CRON_SECRET` unset; prod requires both presence and match; returns 500 (not 401) when secret missing in prod to distinguish misconfiguration from unauthorized access.
- `/lib/soft-delete.ts` — `purgeExpiredRecords` uses parameterized Drizzle queries; ownership enforced in `softDelete`/`restore` by userId/profileId; no user-controlled SQL.

## Auth Flow Review — 2026-05-03 (eng + design review)

Branch: preview/trials-impeccable
Reviewed: LoginForm, SignupForm, ResetRequestForm, ResetConfirmForm, RoleSelector, OnboardingShell, login/signup/reset-password pages

### SHIPPED — fixes applied this session ✅

- ✅ **[DX] Shared `AuthPageBackground` component** — auth page background HTML (glow orbs, dot grid, vignette) was duplicated verbatim across login/signup/reset-password pages. Extracted to `AuthPageBackground.tsx`. All 3 pages now import it.
- ✅ **[A11Y] `tabIndex={-1}` on password show/hide buttons** — keyboard users couldn't toggle password visibility; the button was skipped in tab order. Changed to `tabIndex={0}` in LoginForm, SignupForm, ResetConfirmForm.
- ✅ **[A11Y] Missing `role="alert"` + `aria-live` on reset form states** — ResetRequestForm and ResetConfirmForm had no ARIA announcements on error or success. Screen readers were silent. Added `role="alert" aria-live="polite"` to all error and success state divs. Added `aria-hidden="true"` to all decorative icons.
- ✅ **[A11Y] Error moved above submit button in LoginForm** — error was rendered below trust badges, forcing scroll to see it. Moved above submit button so it's visible without scrolling.
- ✅ **[COPY] 🤒 emoji removed from Patient role** — `RoleSelector.tsx` — using a sick-face emoji for cancer patients is inappropriate and unkind. Changed to 💙. Self-care changed from 👤 to 🌟.
- ✅ **[COPY] Role descriptions warmed up** — "Helping someone I love" → "Caring for someone I love", "Managing my own care, with a caregiver" → "Getting support from a loved one", "Managing my own care independently" → "Managing my care on my own".
- ✅ **[COPY] Cold page headlines replaced** — login page h1 "CareCompanion" → "Welcome back", subtitle "AI-powered cancer care for patients & caregivers" → "We're here whenever you need us." Signup h1 → "You're in good hands", subtitle → "Let's set up your account — it only takes a minute." Reset page h1 → "Forgot your password?", subtitle → "No problem — we'll send a reset link right away."
- ✅ **[COPY] Error messages warmed up** — "Invalid email or password. Please try again." → "That doesn't look right — please check your email and password." Care Group error → "We couldn't find that Care Group — double-check the name and password." Server errors warmed throughout.
- ✅ **[COPY] Reset success copy warmed** — ResetRequest sent state: added "Check your spam folder too." subtext. ResetConfirm success: "You're all set! Your password has been updated. Sign in to continue where you left off."
- ✅ **[UX] Spinner added to ResetRequestForm and ResetConfirmForm** — both forms showed only "Sending…" / "Resetting…" text during loading; now show animated spinner matching LoginForm/SignupForm.
- ✅ **[UX] Success state animations** — ResetRequestForm and ResetConfirmForm success screens snap-replaced with no animation. Added `loginFadeUp 0.4s ease both` on success card render.
- ✅ **[UX] Social login (Apple + Google) added to SignupForm** — LoginForm had Apple/Google buttons; SignupForm had email-only. Users on the signup page had no way to discover OAuth options. Added both buttons above the form with callbackUrl → `/onboarding`.
- ✅ **[UX] Error icon + support link parity in SignupForm** — LoginForm error showed icon + "Having trouble? Contact support" link. SignupForm had icon but no support link. Now consistent.
- ✅ **[DX] RoleSelector inline `<style>` tag removed** — responsive grid was implemented via a `<style>` tag with a media query. Replaced with Tailwind responsive classes.
- ✅ **[LINT] Unused `trialB` variable removed** — `clinicalTrialsAgent.test.ts:32`.

### OPEN — HIGH

- [ ] **[DRY] Extract FloatingInput + PasswordInput to shared component** — `LoginForm.tsx`, `SignupForm.tsx`, `ResetRequestForm.tsx`, `ResetConfirmForm.tsx` all contain identical copy-paste of `FloatingInput` and `PasswordInput`. Any change to label animation, focus ring, or placeholder must be made 4 times. Extract to `@/components/ui/FloatingInput.tsx` and `@/components/ui/PasswordInput.tsx`. **Why:** next time floating label behavior needs to change (e.g. for new form), it will be done incorrectly in at least one copy. **Start:** copy from LoginForm, replace all 4 imports, run lint.

- [ ] **[DRY] Extract shared `FormError` component** — Error display (icon + red message + optional support link) is copy-pasted across all 4 forms with slight inconsistencies. Extract to `@/components/ui/FormError.tsx`. **Props:** `message: string`, `showSupport?: boolean`. **Why:** ensures ARIA attributes, icon, and support link are always present and consistent.

- [ ] **[A11Y] Floating label contrast at `rgba(255,255,255,0.3)` fails WCAG AA** — inactive label is ~3:1 on `#05060F` background. WCAG 2.1 AA requires 4.5:1 for normal text. Bump to at least `rgba(255,255,255,0.5)` for inactive state. **Affects:** FloatingInput in all 4 auth forms.

### OPEN — MEDIUM

- [ ] **[UX] "Resend reset email" CTA on password reset sent screen** — ResetRequestForm success state has no way for the user to re-trigger the email if they didn't receive it. Add a "Resend email" button with a 60s cooldown. **Why:** cancer patients may be on mobile with unreliable email delivery; they'll hit Back and try again repeatedly otherwise, each attempt silently creating a new token.

- [ ] **[UX] Role collection for social (OAuth) signup** — When a new user signs up via Apple/Google, they hit `/onboarding` without a `role` set on their user record. `OnboardingShell` derives role from `userRoleProp` (null for OAuth users) and falls back to relationship — also null for brand-new users. The Care Group screen renders with `careGroupRole = 'patient'` as a hardcoded fallback. Add a role-selection step for new OAuth users before the Care Group screen. **Blocked by:** requires a small `set-role` API endpoint or inline wizard step.

- [ ] **[UX] Progress indicator on onboarding wizard** — `OnboardingShell` moves through phases (care-group → wizard → complete) with no visual indication of where the user is. For patients/caregivers who are anxious about setup time, a simple "Step 1 of 3" or progress bar reduces abandonment. **Depends on:** knowledge of total wizard steps from `OnboardingWizard`.

- [ ] **[UX] `window.location.href` in OnboardingShell should be documented** — `OnboardingShell.tsx:167` uses hard navigation to `/dashboard` on completion. This is intentional (full session refresh needed post-onboarding) but looks like a bug to a future reader. Add a one-line comment: `// Full reload to flush session state after onboarding`.

### OPEN — LOW

- [ ] **[COPY] Signup consent checkbox copy could be warmer** — "I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy, and I understand CareCompanion will access and process my health information to provide the service." The second clause ("access and process") sounds clinical/legal. Consider: "…and I'm comfortable with CareCompanion storing my health information to provide personalized support."

- [ ] **[COPY] Care Group tab inputs lack `required` attribute** — `LoginForm.tsx:242-261` — group name and group password inputs have no `required` attribute. Client-side validation fires nothing when submitted empty; the server returns a generic credential error. Add `required` to both inputs for immediate feedback.

- [ ] **[A11Y] `RoleSelector` error message needs `role="alert"`** — `RoleSelector.tsx:92` — `<p className="mt-1 text-xs text-red-400">{error}</p>` has no ARIA role. Screen readers won't announce "Please select your role to continue" when it appears. Add `role="alert"`.

- [ ] **[DESIGN] Password strength labels feel clinical** — "Weak / Fair / Good / Strong" is neutral but cold for a cancer care app. Consider: "Keep going… / Almost there / Looking good / Strong ✓". Low priority — password strength is a functional concern, but the micro-copy still touches the user experience.

## Care Tab Flow Review — 2026-05-02 (preview/trials-impeccable)

/plan-eng-review + /plan-design-review — `CareHubView`, `CareView`, `care/page.tsx`, `care-hub/page.tsx`, `CareSkeleton`

### Fixed ✅ (implemented this session)

- [x] **[BUG] `adherencePercent` always 100%** — `CareHubView.tsx:185` — `(n/n)*100` = 100 regardless of actual adherence. Caregivers monitoring compliance saw misleading "100%" in the radar card. Zeroed until actual adherence tracking (logged vs scheduled) is implemented.
  - **Why:** Clinical integrity — a caregiver seeing 100% adherence when none is tracked could falsely assume the patient is compliant.

- [x] **[BUG] Appointment subtitle rendered "undefined · Mon, May 4"** — `CareView.tsx:270` — `{appt.specialty} · {dateStr}` when specialty is null rendered literal "undefined". Fixed: build `subtitleParts` array filtering null, join with ` · `.

- [x] **[BUG] Profile query non-deterministic** — `care/page.tsx:22` — `.limit(1)` with no `ORDER BY`. Same pattern as `layout-onboarding-gate-non-deterministic` learning. Fixed: added `.orderBy(asc(careProfiles.createdAt))`.

- [x] **[PERF] Dynamic imports had no loading fallback** — `CareView.tsx:16-18` — `LabsView`, `SymptomJournal`, `CareTeamView` loaded with no `loading` option. Tab switch showed flash of empty space while module loaded. Fixed: all three get a pulsing 3-card skeleton via `loading: () => <TabLoader />`.

- [x] **[DESIGN] `CareSkeleton` didn't match real page structure** — `skeletons/CareSkeleton.tsx` — Showed segment bar + 3 cards + button. Real page has TreatmentCycleTracker, segment control, cards, AdherenceCalendar, ComplianceReport, CaregiverBurnoutCard — ~6 sections. Layout shift was significant. Fixed: updated skeleton to approximate all 6 sections.

- [x] **[DESIGN/A11Y] CareHubView section headers low contrast** — `CareHubView.tsx:265,293,322,355` — `text-[var(--text-muted)]` (~3.4:1) on uppercase labels fails WCAG AA. Fixed: changed all 4 to `text-[var(--text-secondary)]`.

- [x] **[DESIGN] Emoji in CareHub care group banner** — `CareHubView.tsx:227` — `👨‍👩‍👧` as UI element, same pattern flagged/fixed on dashboard. Fixed: replaced with inline SVG people icon.

- [x] **[COPY] Appointment empty state was clinical** — `CareView.tsx:329` — "No appointments scheduled" with no CTA. Cold for a cancer patient's care tab. Fixed: "You're all clear — no upcoming appointments." + add-appointment button inline in the empty state.

- [x] **[COPY] Delete confirmation cold/legal tone** — `CareView.tsx:444` — "Are you sure you want to delete...? This action cannot be undone." Fixed: "Remove this medication/appointment from your list? This can't be undone." Also changed "Delete" button to "Remove".

- [x] **[COPY] CareHub empty state CTA misleading** — `CareHubView.tsx:202` — "Complete First Check-in" linked to `/dashboard` with no further guidance. Fixed: "Do today's check-in" + copy that explains check-in lives on Home tab.

- [x] **[UX] No Enter key submit on form inputs** — `CareView.tsx` — Med and appointment form inputs had no keyboard submit. Mobile users had to reach for the save button. Fixed: all text inputs in both forms get `onKeyDown={(e) => e.key === 'Enter' && handleAdd...()}`.

- [x] **[UX] Add Medication form missing prescribing doctor field** — `CareView.tsx` — Schema has `prescribingDoctor` column, displayed in the expanded card, but the form never collected it. Fixed: added "Prescribing doctor" input to the form, wired into the POST body.

- [x] **[COPY] Appointment "Purpose" label was generic** — `CareView.tsx:422` — "Purpose" + placeholder "e.g., Annual checkup" felt routine/clinical. Fixed: label becomes "What's this visit for?" + placeholder "e.g., Chemo infusion, follow-up" which mirrors actual cancer care language.

- [x] **[COPY] Appointment "Specialty" placeholder was generic** — `CareView.tsx:410` — "e.g., Cardiology" as specialty placeholder. Changed to "e.g., Oncology" — the most common specialty in this app.

### Deferred (TODO)

- [ ] **[BUG] `adherencePercent` still 0 — needs real adherence data** — `CareHubView.tsx:185` — Adherence should be computed from `reminderLogs` (scheduled vs completed today). The `SymptomRadarCard` receives this value. Right now it will always show 0.
  - **Why:** Caregivers rely on adherence tracking to coordinate patient care.
  - **Where to start:** Add adherence query to `/api/care-hub` endpoint: count `reminderLogs` where `scheduledTime >= todayStart AND loggedAt IS NOT NULL` vs total `scheduledTime >= todayStart`. Pass as `adherencePercent`.

- [ ] **[BUG] CareHubView medications card shows checkmark for all meds (implies taken)** — `CareHubView.tsx:274` — All medications display a green checkmark regardless of whether they were actually logged. Clinically misleading for caregivers.
  - **Why:** A caregiver seeing checkmarks may assume the patient took all meds when none were logged.
  - **Fix:** Cross-reference `data.medications` against today's `reminderLogs` (already available in API response); only show checkmark if a log entry exists for that med today.

- [ ] **[UX] No scroll-to-top on CareView tab switch** — `CareView.tsx:282` — Switching Meds → Labs keeps scroll position from the previous tab. If meds list is long, user lands partway down the labs tab.
  - **Fix:** Call `window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })` in the `onChange` handler passed to `SegmentControl`.

- [ ] **[UX] Medications "Edit" uses chat route instead of inline editing** — `CareView.tsx:193` — "Edit" button navigates to `/chat?prompt=Update my {med.name}...`. Not a real edit form. Users who want to fix a dose typo must use conversational AI.
  - **Why:** Clinical data entry errors on medication records are common and need a direct correction path.
  - **Fix:** Replace chat link with an inline edit form or a dedicated edit bottom sheet (mirrors the existing add form).

- [ ] **[A11Y] ExpandableCard aria-label missing on Care tab cards** — `CareView.tsx:172,228` — Same issue as dashboard: screen readers announce "button, collapsed" with no description. Pass `aria-label` derived from med name / appointment doctor.
  - **Fix:** Add optional `aria-label` prop to `ExpandableCard` and pass `"${med.name} medication details"` / `"Appointment with ${appt.doctorName}"`.

- [ ] **[PERF] Serial care group queries** — `care-hub/page.tsx:44-53` — `careGroupMembers.findFirst` then `careGroups.findFirst` — sequential round-trips. Already simplified to conditional lookup; consider a single JOIN query for one DB round-trip.

- [ ] **[UX] DashboardInsights tab switch no loading state** — `DashboardInsights.tsx:50` — Switching between Lab Trends / Refills / Wellness shows empty content while child fetches. Already tracked in Dashboard deferred section, relevant here too.

- [ ] **[COPY] Treatment phase badge "Evaluating" isolates uncertain patients** — `DashboardView.tsx:44` — For `treatmentPhase: 'unsure'`, shows "Evaluating." Frames uncertainty passively. Consider "Getting Answers" to convey active engagement during a scary time.
  - **Why:** Patients who don't yet have a clear diagnosis are often the most anxious — the label they see every session matters.

- [ ] **[MISSING FEATURE] No visit summary / post-appointment note** — Care tab appointments expand to show visit prep, but no way to record what happened at the appointment (notes, next steps, what the doctor said).
  - **Why:** Patients and caregivers often forget details from appointments. A simple notes field would dramatically improve continuity of care.
  - **Where to start:** Add optional `notes` + `followUpDate` fields to the `appointments` schema. Show them in the expanded card with a quick inline editor.

- [ ] **[MISSING FEATURE] No medication taken/skipped logging from Care tab** — `CareView.tsx` meds tab shows meds but has no "Mark taken" / "Mark skipped" action.
  - **Why:** The daily check-in tracks mood/pain/energy but not medication adherence directly from the care tab. Users wanting to log a med should be able to do it without going through the AI chat.
  - **Where to start:** Add a "Logged" button to each med card's expanded content that writes to `reminderLogs`. Show today's log status as a pill badge on the med card header.

## Onboarding Flow Review — 2026-05-03 (preview/trials-impeccable)

Reviewer: /plan-eng-review + /plan-design-review

### Fixed ✅ (implemented this session)

- [x] **[BUG/P1] Social auth (Google/Apple) bypass role selection** — `SignupForm.tsx` — Clicking "Continue with Apple/Google" before selecting a role silently created users with `role: null` in DB. `OnboardingWizard` then always routed them to `PatientWizard` regardless of caregiver intent. Fixed: added role validation before `signIn()` call; social auth now requires role selection first and passes `?role=caregiver|patient|self` in callbackUrl. `OnboardingPage` (server component) writes the role to DB on first onboarding load.
  - **Files:** `SignupForm.tsx`, `onboarding/page.tsx`

- [x] **[BUG/P1] `patchProfile()` swallowed errors silently** — `PatientWizard.tsx`, `CaregiverWizard.tsx` — Both wizards called `patchProfile()` (a fire-and-forget fetch with no `try/catch`). If the save failed (network error, 5xx), users continued through the wizard unaware, completing onboarding with no data saved. Fixed: `patchProfile` now returns `boolean`; each advance checks the result and shows a styled error message if it fails.
  - **Files:** `PatientWizard.tsx`, `CaregiverWizard.tsx`

- [x] **[BUG/P2] `OnboardingWelcomeBanner` never showed** — `OnboardingShell.tsx` — Banner reads `onboarding_just_completed` from localStorage but nothing ever wrote it. Newly onboarded users never saw the welcome banner with action cards. Fixed: `OnboardingShell` sets `onboarding_just_completed = 'true'` and clears `welcome_banner_dismissed` before redirecting to `/dashboard`. Storage errors in private browsing are caught silently.
  - **File:** `OnboardingShell.tsx`

- [x] **[UX/P2] `OnboardingShell` null-screen edge case** — `OnboardingShell.tsx` — Final `return null` at the bottom of the component rendered a blank screen if none of the phase conditions matched (e.g., `phase=wizard`, `wizardProfileId=null` after profile creation race). Fixed: replaced with a spinner loading state.
  - **File:** `OnboardingShell.tsx`

- [x] **[A11Y/P2] `CareGroupScreen` inputs had no id/htmlFor pairing** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — Both group name and group password inputs were visually labelled but labels had no `htmlFor` and inputs had no `id`. Screen readers couldn't associate labels with inputs. Fixed: added `id="care-group-name"` / `id="care-group-password"` and matching `htmlFor`. Also added `autoComplete` attributes.
  - **File:** `CareGroupScreen.tsx`

- [x] **[DESIGN/P2] `CareGroupScreen` error display was unstyled** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — Errors showed as bare `<p style={{color:'#ef4444'}}>` — mismatched with the red error box pattern used in `LoginForm` and `SignupForm`. Fixed: replaced with proper `role="alert"` error box (icon + message).
  - **File:** `CareGroupScreen.tsx`

- [x] **[DESIGN/P2] No step transition animation in wizard** — `PatientWizard.tsx`, `CaregiverWizard.tsx` — Each wizard step change was an instant hard-cut. For a premium app serving cancer patients, this felt jarring. Fixed: added `wizardStepIn` CSS keyframe (`opacity 0→1, translateY 10px→0, 250ms ease`) keyed by step number so animation re-fires on every advance.
  - **Files:** `PatientWizard.tsx`, `CaregiverWizard.tsx`

- [x] **[UX/P2] Wizard advance buttons showed no loading feedback** — Both wizards had buttons that said "Saving..." on load but had no spinner. Easy to double-tap on mobile. Fixed: all primary wizard action buttons now show an animated spinner + context-appropriate copy ("Saving…") while disabled.
  - **Files:** `PatientWizard.tsx`, `CaregiverWizard.tsx`

- [x] **[COPY/P2] Clinical/cold copy throughout wizard** — Multiple files — Several headings and messages used language inappropriate for cancer patients and caregivers. Fixed:
  - `CaregiverWizard` step 1: "About your patient" → "About the person you're caring for" (a caregiver may be a spouse, not a clinical caregiver)
  - `CaregiverWizard` step 1: patient name label "Patient name *" → "Their name *"  
  - `CaregiverWizard` step 2: challenge framing → "What's weighing on you most right now?"
  - `CaregiverWizard` step 3: "Ask your patient to connect" → "Ask {name} to connect" (uses actual name)
  - `CaregiverWizard` step 4: "About the diagnosis" → richer subtext with "You can always edit it later"
  - `CaregiverWizard` step 5: "Your priorities" → "What matters most to you?"
  - `CaregiverWizard` notifications: "Stay informed" → "You're almost set up" with warmer description
  - `PatientWizard` notifications: "Stay on top of your care" → "You're almost there" with warmer copy
  - `CareGroupScreen`: "Set up your Care Group 👨‍👩‍👧" → "Your Care Group 💜"
  - `CareGroupScreen`: "Waiting for your patient to join..." → "Waiting for them to join — this may take a moment."
  - `CareGroupScreen`: "Create a new Care Group" → "Create a Care Group" (cleaner)
  - `CareGroupScreen`: "Skip for now" → "Skip for now — I'll set this up later"
  - `CareGroupScreen` loading: "Loading..." → "Creating your group…" / "Joining…" (context-specific)
  - `RoleSelector` descriptions: "Getting support from a loved one" → "Managing my care with loved ones" (more empowering for patients)
  - **Files:** `CaregiverWizard.tsx`, `PatientWizard.tsx`, `CareGroupScreen.tsx`, `RoleSelector.tsx`

- [x] **[A11Y/P2] Wizard `select` elements had no `id`/`label` pairing** — `CaregiverWizard.tsx` — Native `<select>` elements for relationship, cancer type, stage, and treatment phase had visual labels but no `id` attributes, so `htmlFor` on the labels had nothing to point to. Fixed: added `id="cg-relationship"`, `id="cg-cancer-type"`, `id="cg-stage"`, `id="cg-phase"` with matching `htmlFor`.
  - **File:** `CaregiverWizard.tsx`

- [x] **[UX/P3] Priority selection: no visual feedback when 3-item limit hit** — `PatientWizard.tsx`, `CaregiverWizard.tsx` — After selecting 3 priorities, remaining items just didn't respond to clicks with no explanation. Fixed: unselectable items become 50% opacity and show "(limit reached)" inline label.
  - **Files:** `PatientWizard.tsx`, `CaregiverWizard.tsx`

- [x] **[A11Y/P3] `CareGroupScreen` "Back" button had no accessible label** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx` — "← Back" was plain text, not a semantic button with `aria-label`. Replaced with chevron icon + "Back" text and proper `aria-label="Go back"`.
  - **File:** `CareGroupScreen.tsx`

### Open (TODO)

- [ ] **[DRY/P3] `FloatingInput` and `PasswordInput` duplicated in `LoginForm.tsx` and `SignupForm.tsx`** — Byte-for-byte identical (95+ lines each). Extract to `@/components/ui/FloatingInput.tsx` and `@/components/ui/PasswordInput.tsx`.
  - **Why:** Any change to input behavior (focus ring, animation, error state) must be made twice. Already diverged: `SignupForm` has `showStrength` prop that `LoginForm` doesn't know about.
  - **Where to start:** Create `apps/web/src/components/ui/FloatingInput.tsx`; import in both forms.

- [ ] **[BUG/P2] `nextAppointment` in PatientWizard confirm + manual steps collected but not saved** — `PatientWizard.tsx:140-152` — Confirm screen "Next appointment" field and manual entry date input are shown to patients but `careProfiles` has no `nextAppointment` column. Both are silently dropped.
  - **Why:** Patients entering this during onboarding reasonably expect it to appear in their care timeline.
  - **Fix:** Add `nextAppointmentDate` timestamptz to `careProfiles`; add to PATCH allowlist; save in both wizard paths.

- [ ] **[MISSING FEATURE/P2] No onboarding progress persistence** — If a user refreshes mid-wizard, they restart from step 1. For a cancer patient who may be interrupted or low-energy, losing wizard progress is painful.
  - **Why:** Onboarding can take 5–10 minutes for caregivers (6 steps). A page refresh loses all selections.
  - **Fix:** Save wizard step + field values to `sessionStorage` on each advance; restore on mount if `careProfileId` matches.
  - **Where to start:** `CaregiverWizard.tsx`, `PatientWizard.tsx` — add `useEffect` on each `step` state change.

- [ ] **[MISSING FEATURE/P2] Returning user visits `/onboarding` and re-enters wizard** — `OnboardingShell.tsx:48` — If `onboardingCompleted = true` and a user navigates to `/onboarding` (e.g., from a bookmark), they re-enter the wizard on their completed profile. Should redirect to `/dashboard` with a "You're already set up" message.
  - **Fix:** In `onboarding/page.tsx`, check if all profiles have `onboardingCompleted = true`; if so, redirect to `/dashboard`.

- [ ] **[UX/P3] QR invite polling silently stops at 30s** — `CareGroupScreen.tsx:114` — After 30 seconds with no join, the polling interval clears and the waiting state persists forever with no feedback. User doesn't know whether to keep waiting or give up.
  - **Fix:** On timeout, replace "Waiting for them to join…" with "Still waiting — they can join later using the invite link." and change the pulsing dot to static.

- [ ] **[BUG/P3] `self` role routes to `PatientWizard`** — `OnboardingWizard.tsx:17` — Both `patient` and `self` fall through to `PatientWizard`. If `self` is meant for users managing their own care proactively (not a diagnosed cancer patient), the HealthKit and diagnosis steps don't apply. Intentional or missing `SelfWizard`?
  - **Where to start:** Confirm intended behavior with product. If different, add `SelfWizard` or a simplified 2-step version.

- [ ] **[SECURITY/P2] CSRF missing on `/api/auth/set-role`, `/api/care-group`, `/api/care-group/join`** — Already tracked in Auth Audit. These onboarding mutation endpoints lack `validateCsrf()`. Session cookie is `sameSite: lax` which does not prevent cross-site POSTs from non-GET redirects.

- [ ] **[SECURITY/P3] Role-via-URL param can be crafted for new social sign-up users** — `onboarding/page.tsx:23` — An attacker can craft a link `https://app.com/onboarding?role=caregiver` and any new OAuth user completing sign-up via that link will have their role set to `caregiver` without seeing the role-selection UI. Not a privilege escalation (all roles have identical access); the user will see the wrong wizard immediately and be confused. Pre-existing risk: before this fix, social users had `role: null` entirely.
  - **Fix:** Move role assignment to the NextAuth JWT/session callback using a signed state parameter passed through the OAuth flow, rather than reading from an unprotected searchParam. Alternatively, prompt new users whose role was set via URL to confirm their role on the onboarding first screen.
  - **Where to start:** `apps/web/src/lib/auth.config.ts` — NextAuth `signIn` callback can read `account.state` if role is signed into the OAuth state param.

- [ ] **[TEST/P2] Zero test coverage for onboarding UI** — `LoginForm`, `SignupForm`, `PatientWizard`, `CaregiverWizard`, `CareGroupScreen`, `OnboardingShell` have no tests. The social-auth role bypass (now fixed) had no regression test — and was a real P1 bug.
  - **Highest priority tests to add:**
    - `SignupForm`: social auth with no role shows error; with role passes role to callbackUrl
    - `PatientWizard`: patchProfile failure shows error, does not advance step
    - `CareGroupScreen`: create group shows spinner; error shows styled alert
  - **Where to start:** `apps/web/src/__tests__/auth/` — follow `clinicalTrialsAgent.test.ts` pattern using `vi.mock`.

- [ ] **[COPY/P3] PatientWizard "Connect Apple Health" button is misleading on web** — Already tracked in Onboarding Audit (see above). Label should read "Review my health data" or "Check what we know" since no real HealthKit connection happens on web.
